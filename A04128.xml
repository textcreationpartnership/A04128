            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It may pleaſe your GRACE to remember, that the Church of Rome, was at this time like the Moone when ſhee is orient, illuſtrious for her faith, ſpoken of
<pb facs="tcp:7847:3"/>through the whole world,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.8.</note> ſhining in all Chriſtian piety, and made gloriouſly red with the blood of her Martyrs. Yet was there a duskie miſt raiſed about her, which did much obſcure her glory. For though ſhe erred not in fundamentalls, as did the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> in the article of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; nor with the Church of <hi>Galatia,</hi> mixed the Law with the Goſpell, as if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion were an extract of both, as the Socinians at this day; yet in things of leſſe conſequence God permitted the envious man to ſow the ſeeds of contention in this goodly field,<note place="margin">Gen. 16.12.</note> till, as ſo many <hi>Iſhmaels,</hi> every mans hand was againſt every man.</p>
            <p>The things in queſtion were (if any can be ſuch in the time of the Goſpell, of which no ſober man doubts) of an indifferent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as meats and daies; the parties contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were the ſtrong, and the weake in faith, the manner of the contention amounted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Schiſme, whilſt the ſtrong rejected the weake with ſcorne, and contempt; and the weake fell to their common ward of judging
<pb facs="tcp:7847:3"/>and condemning the ſtrong. It was therefore high time for the Apoſtle to put to his hand; he is a maſter-builder, and knowes that a houſe divided cannot ſtand; of all things therefore hee laboured to procure amongſt them a ſetled peace; ſince, as<note n="a" place="margin">Inveniat vos diabolus mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitos, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiâ arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos, quia pax veſtra bellum eſt illi. <hi>Tert: ad Martyres.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, the Churches peace is to Satan, the old ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my thereof, a continuall warre. Now the way which the Apoſtle takes in the worke, is ſuch, as never failes of its effect, the way of knowledge, and the way of love; a mutuall receiving of one another into a good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a moderate diſcuſsing of the points in controverſy. This latter will doe little good without the former, for till we can be content to receiue one another as brethren; wee ſhall never ſatisfie one another as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.

But how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and almoſt unpoſsible a thing it is, to be thus temperate, the continually interrupted peace of the Church in all ages hath made too-too apparent; eſpecially in the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings here ſpoken of, whoſe religion hath much more of zeale, then of knowledge. For that the Church ſhould conſiſt of none, but of ſtrong, is an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian</hi> fancie of the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, whoſe Church is a Moone without ſpots; a family, in which are no children; a firmament, in which are no ſtarres, but of the firſt magnitude. The true Church of Chriſt ever was, and will be a mixt congregation; in this, like <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> Image, which had
<pb facs="tcp:7847:4"/>mixed feet of clay and Iron. There remaineth therefore the Apoſtles other remedy, which is not only to receive them into our hearts, but to ſupport them alſo with our hands, whilſt with the one eye we looke upon their perſons, with the other upon their opinions, bringing theſe into publique light, (for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they lurke in corners) and the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of diſputations.<note n="a" place="margin">Tertullian.</note> 
               <hi>Suſpecta eſſe debuit, quae vult occludi:</hi> that doctrine juſtly deſerves to be ſuſpected, which deſires to be concealed. But herein alſo the Apoſtle directs us by a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for ſome diſputations are perplext, and perplexing; others not ſo, but ſerve to cleare the Vnderſtanding, &amp; ſettle the Conſcience. The former ſort have ever been the bane of the Church, a worme bred in religion, and eating out the very bowels thereof. To repreſſe theſe kinds of diſputes, &amp; to confine turbulent ſearching witts, hath ever been the wiſdome of the Church. Such wranglings the Apoſtle doth even abhorre, as fitter for the Schooles of Heathens,<note place="margin">2 Tim, 2.23.</note> then of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; being (how profound ſoever they
<pb facs="tcp:7847:5"/>ſeeme) fooliſh and unlearned, good only to beget new janglings, filling the Church with diſputing, not edifying. Such therefore were ever dangerous, ending alwaies in greater ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">

            <p>That theſe queſtions of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> are things of this nature many haue long ſince complained, and Your GRACE doth eaſily diſcerne.

<pb facs="tcp:7847:6"/>were but timorouſly ſet afoot by their firſt maſters; yet how deepely they are now roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who ſeeth not? and how the hearts of men are thereby alien'd one from another? how ſuch, as dare contradict them, are made even Anathema; all religion being reduced to this one head, the obſervation of the Sabbath: How a manifeſt ſchiſme is raiſed thereby (ſo farre at leaſt, as for fear of Authority men dare adventure) a weake eye may diſcerne. So dangerous hath been the long connivence of the Church, and ſilence of her ſonnes; whilſt ſome have undervalued theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as too meane ſpeculations for men of great abilities to be ingaged in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others have been contented to ſee well-affected people to be drawn on in Religion by this holy fraud.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD Chriſtian Reader expect not to be courted with fruitleſse Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies; I deſire only to informe thee concerning this preſent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, which is now thine. That which I intended, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my thoughts firſt looked this way, was my owne ſatisfaction. For though I were not a ſtranger to theſe Queſtions, nor tooke vp theſe tenents by occaſion of the Kings Declaration (an aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion faſtned upon many an honeſt man) but had declared my ſelfe therein for many yeares before, as ſome who are contrary-minded can beare me witneſſe: Yet when of late they fell into agitation, I confeſſe the ſtrange confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of moſt, the reſolute ſufferings of ſome began to ſtagger me. For I conceived, that I not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſearched, and that ſomething ſurely had eſcaped me; elſe it was (I thought) not poſsible, that men of good
<pb facs="tcp:7847:8"/>apprehenſions, honeſt diſpoſitions, and well qualified with ſundry parts of learning ſhould not only ſtick at them, but oppoſe them alſo even with hazzard. This was the cauſe why I not only weighed ſuch arguments, as Treatiſes of this nature afforded: but ſuch alſo as either my ſelfe could frame, or my poore ſlender reading help me unto. This I held fit to acquaint thee with, leaſt thou ſhouldst perhaps think that I affected a <hi>Sciomachy</hi> or <hi>Umbratilous</hi> skirmiſh, making a great ſhew of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments only to make a greater ſhew of anſweres. But God knowes I intended herein ſatisfaction, not oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to ſee what might be as well, as what was already ſaid. To which purpoſe I have alſo faithfully related the reaſons of our Adverſaries, and added ſuch weight unto them by preſsing them home, as my weak under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding inabled me without partiality, deſiring only light, which I alwaies profeſſed to follow, if they afforded any. But here if I have at any time for pities ſake left untouched certaine places of Scripture, miſerably tortured, I feare wilfully wreſted, (a common and great fault in them with whom we deale) let me be pardoned this injury. Shews and flouriſhes, which an Artiſt may convey into a well pen'd diſcourſe, may goe for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing evidences amongſt the vulgar. He deſerves not the name of a Scholar or Orator that cannot by this meanes make any Paradox extreamly probable; for it is not eaſy for a common eye to diſtinguiſh ſhadowes from ſubſtances, eſpecially when they are wrapt up together under the ſpecious titles of piety. And this was the only reaſon of my method, which being that of the Schooles is
<pb facs="tcp:7847:8"/>of all others (if uſed with ſobriety) most ſatisfying. It is not then the pleaſing of thy fancy with quaint language, and apt cadences of words: nor the drawing of thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with patheticall exclamations of holineſſe, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp;c. nor appeales to mens conſciences, by which they are artificilly caught before encountred, which I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; to ſuch straines I profeſſe my ſelfe a ſtranger; but the unmasking of all apparences, and diſcovery of naked truth. And here let no man be offended, if I ſpeak freely, that I have not found any convincing proofe in any point of their doctrine, wherein we differ, either out of the word of God, or well governed reaſon. It is therefore to be feared, that men ſeek themſelves, not truth herein. And ſure ſelfe-ſeeking is more waies then one; not only the deſire of profit, preferment, favour, greatneſſe: but thoſe poorer phantaſmes of popularity, opinion of being the un-erring <hi>Rabbies</hi> in the Church, or making good a ſide hunted after makes us guilty thereof. And amongſt the reſt there is no ſuch ſelfe-ſeeking as ſingularity,<note place="margin">Signa ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritatis non continere ſe intra ſuos fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; faſtidire dostrinas reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutas; indebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta doctorum &amp; doctrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atio; gaudere potius de alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nâ impugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The which thing as he did to them of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times before, reuealing unto them ſundry truths, wherewith their predeceſſors never were acquainted: ſo dealt he with the Primitve Fathers in their ſeverall times, and ſo perhaps he will doe with them that follow us. So he hath done to this age of ours; and as he hath done it in ſundry other truths, ſo alſo in this of the Chriſtian Sabbath.</q>

To have erred may be the ſhame of our naturall frailty: but to acknowledge our errors is the praiſe of our Chriſtian ingenuity, and to reforme them our glory.

                  <hi>CAP. I.</hi> Wherein the firſt queſtion is propoſed, with the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeeming to prove the Sabbath to be as ancient, as <hi>Adam</hi> in paradiſe.</head>
               <p>AS in the maladies of the body, the ſymptomes are removed, when the roote of the diſeaſe is purged out: ſo our errors (the only ſickneſſe of our minds) are reformed, when the foundations, on which they are built, are overthrowne. Our firſt queſtion therefore is, when the Sabbath had its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; whether it were commanded Adam, and the Patriarches immediatly from God himſelfe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; or only to the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, by the miniſtery of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The former tenent ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to have many evidences, both from Scripture, from reaſon, and from the authority of many of the Learned.</p>
               <p>Firſt, from the words of <hi>Moſes, So Gold bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it, becauſe in it hee reſted from all his works,</hi> an argument may be framed thus. The reſting of God from all his works, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſanctifying of the Sabbath, were coetaneous; for when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>So God bleſſed,</hi> he referrs us both to the reaſon <hi>why,</hi> and the time <hi>when,</hi> and the manner <hi>how</hi> the Sabbath was firſt inſtituted: but God reſted from all his works immediatly from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while <hi>Adam</hi> was yet in Paradiſe; therefore, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly

               <p>Eightly, God left not <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Patriarches without any neceſſary inſtructions, (for God never failes in neceſſaries) but the Sabbath contained matter of neceſſary inſtructions for <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; the Patriarches;

                  <hi>Aquinas,</hi> both in his ſummes, and upon the ſentences, affirmeth as much: There is (ſaith he) a two-fold perfection; the one, wherein things receive their perfect being, this all things had upon the ſixt day; the other, which regardeth not the being, but only the operation of things in being; this was beſtowed on creatures the ſeventh day, for then God reſting from giving being unto things, began to ſet nature to the worke of propagation; but any man
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7847:18"/>may ſee. Firſt, that this is only ſaid without any ground. Secondly, that he was forced thereunto, by labouring to reconcile the vulgar tranſlation with that of Saint <hi>Auſtin;</hi> the one reading, in the ſeventh day, the other in the ſixt day <hi>God ended his worke.</hi>

                  </note> one obſerves rightly, that the text ſaith, <hi>God bleſsed the day,</hi> not the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; ſo that if it were true, that nature binds us to keepe thoſe very daies, on which we have received mercies; <hi>Adam</hi> was obliged to the Friday, which, I thinke, no man will preſume to affirme.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whatſoever was commanded <hi>Adam</hi> in paradiſe was univerſally commanded unto all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in all their generations, for we were all in <hi>Adam,</hi> neither had our firſt parents any perſonall or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary precept: but the Law of the ſeventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is of no ſuch univerſall extent, neither is it ſtill in force. The firſt appears, becauſe the<note n="d" place="margin">So <hi>Moſes,</hi> The Lord hath given you the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. Exod. 16.29. So <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> thou madeſt knowne unto them thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sabbath, by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> thy ſervant. Neb. 9.14. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.12. reckoning up Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to that nation, ſaith, moreover I gave them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths.</note> Scriptures doe ever appropriate the Sabbath as a peculiar rite pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Iewes: The ſecond is alſo manifeſt; for we obſerve not at this day that Sabbath, which is ſaid to have been given <hi>Adam,</hi> which we muſt have done
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7847:19"/>had it been commanded in paradiſe, unleſſe we could ſhew expreſſe precepts given to Adam to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but ſuch a countermaine, certaine it is, Adam ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that which is eyther naturall, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in Paradiſe before the fall, was not to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated by Chriſt in the fulneſſe of time: the reaſon hereof is, becauſe that fulneſſe of time, wherein Chriſt came, and did all things appertaining to the Meſſias, is to be reckoned from the promiſe of the ſeed, which was not made till after the fall; that therefore, which preceeded this promiſe, appertained not to the Meſſias, either to eſtabliſh, or aboliſh: but the obſervation of that Sabbath, which is pretended to have been commanded Adam in paradiſe, is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by Chriſt, as he is the Meſſias; even that day, on which God reſted, and which he ſanctified, which the Church of Chriſt neither doth, nor ought to keep: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, if the Sabbath had been obſerved by the Patriarches before <hi>Moſes;</hi> it is no way likely, but that ſome footſteps of ſuch their obſervation would have appeared in the Story, wherein many things, of leſſe weight, &amp; leſſe tending to edification, are punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally recited. In the firſt ſacrifice <hi>Moſes</hi> obſerves the names of the men, the quality of their oblations, the ſucceſſe of both. All men know, that the fitteſt time for ſuch obſervances was the Sabbath: would <hi>Moſes</hi> (think you) haue omitted this circumſtance, who is ſo exact in all other? For 'its moſt congruous to think,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7847:19"/>if they had then a Sabbath, they would have offered their Sacrifices chiefly upon that Sabbath. In the daies of <hi>Seth men began to call upon the name of the Lord,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting and reforming religion; every man will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the obſervation of the Sabbath is a maine point of reformation; and therefore ſure if their fore-fathers had ever obſerved a Sabbath day, that eſpecially (defaced, no queſtion, among other things) would have been reformed, and this had been a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall point in the ſtory, which yet ſpeakes nothing thereof. It is afterwards ſaid, that <hi>Noah offered a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of reſt,</hi> what fitter time for a ſacrifice of reſt, then the day of reſt? But had this ſacrifice of reſt been offered upon the day of reſt, it had been as remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thing in the ſtory, as that <hi>he builded an altar, and offered of every beaſt, and every fowle,</hi> yet not a word hereof. Come to Abraham, we read of many Altars, which he made to call upon the name of the Lord: a world of ſmall things are recorded of him, yet no mention of any Sabbath, which he ever obſerved. If he had been bound to any ſet Sabbath, doubtleſſe he would have ſealed the promiſes of God unto himſelfe and his family upon that day eſpecially; but the Texttels us, <hi>He circumciſed himſelfe, and his houſhold the ſelfe ſame day, in which the Lord talked with him.</hi> It is hard to proue, that this was the ſeventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and ſuppoſe it, every man will confeſſe it to be an important circumſtance, which yet we read not. The ſtory of <hi>Iacob</hi> is full, and exact, but neither in his flight to <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> nor in his returne to <hi>Canaan,</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:7847:20"/>nor going up to <hi>Bethel</hi> upon ſpeciall command, and reforming his houſhold, nor going down into <hi>Egypt.</hi> nor in his abode there, the leaſt mention is made of a Sabbath obſerved by him. I confeſſe, that a negative argument from authority doth not conclude <hi>de rebus agendis,</hi> to ſhew what is, or is not to be done; but <hi>de rebus actis,</hi> to prove what was, or was not done, with ſuch a concurrence of circumſtances of times, places, perſons, occaſions; in this caſe I ſay, a negative argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is more then probable.<note n="a" place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As ſoone as he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his workes, he ordained, &amp; appointed, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, the day of his owne reſt, ſhould be that, on which his Church ſhould reſt, and follow his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and this was that great bleſſing and prerogative beſtowed on that day.

Yet <hi>Noah,</hi> who was then as it were another Adam, is not commanded to keep that day holy. Was not the birth of our bleſſed Lord (not to ſpeake of his conception, paſſion, aſcenſion &amp;c.) as glorious, as the firſt daies workes; and was it not then alſo in a manner ſaid, <hi>let there be light, a light to lighten the Gentils, and the glory of his people Jſrael?</hi> Yet the Angels, which rejoyced to ſee that day, had no commiſſion to proclaime it holy: neither did God himſelfe appoint it for holy, unleſſe by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinating</hi> it to be hereafter obſerved, by the precept, and practice of the Church, as we ſee at this day. Secondly, when God actually commands his Church the memorialls of his mercies, there is many times a great diſtance ſet betweene the inſtitution, and the obſervation; as appeares in the inſtances gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Iewiſh feſtivals.</p>

               <p>To the ſecond; be it granted that the word in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall be the ſame, which is elſewhere uſed for holy convocations; and that God, when he made thoſe great lights, had an eye to this their uſe, to which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he afterwards appointed them, in the new moones and other feſtivals of the Iews; yet from hence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that from the begining there were ſuch times thus obſerved by the courſe of thoſe great lights, draws blood from the text. For this was neither a principall, nor naturall end of their creation; Though therefore God did appoint the Iewes in their ſolemne feaſts to be guided by the Moone, yet we ſee the Chriſtians follow no ſuch directions. If this had been either a principall, or a naturall end of the moone from the begining; ſurely that which was naturall is become mutable, and we that looke not to this uſe of the Moone in our times of holy convocations, ſave only in a few moveable feaſts, are moſt unnaturall. The whole argument thus grounded upon the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7847:30"/>of the word is in all the parts thereof un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound.</p>

                  <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> ſaith, it is by this place cleerely evinced, that the Sabbath was in uſe amongſt men from the begining, or elſe the whole diſcourſe of the Apoſtle in that place is overthrowne. For tryall whereof, and clearing of this Scripture, we muſt firſt ſet downe the Ieſuits deduction, and then compare it with the text, out of which it is deduced. The words of the Apoſtle are. <hi>We which have beleeved, doe enter into reſt, as it is ſaid. As I have ſworne in my wrath, if they enter into my reſt: although the works were finiſhed from the foundation of the world.</hi> Theſe words,<note n="b" place="margin">Eſt occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, per quam aſcendit Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolus ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicandam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogen Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathi, &amp;c.</note> ſaith he, are brought in by way of preoccupation, wherein the Apoſtle aſcendeth in his diſcourſe to explaine the anagogicall meaning of the Sabbath, and from the reſt thereof, and that of Canaan, to prove, that there remaineth to the true believers a third reſt in heaven: As if the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid,<note n="c" place="margin">Quod du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex requies promiſſa fuit patribus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris, primare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies fuit Sabbathi.</note> God did hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiſe a twofold reſt unto our fathers; the firſt of the Sabbath, in which he commanded them to reſt from their daily labours: the ſecond of Canaan, where he gave them reſt from all their enemies.

                  </gap>. neither of the teſt of the Sabbath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all men were already brought into that reſt from the begining of the world, when God, having perfected the creation, commanded men to reſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in imitation of his reſt: neither doth the Apoſtle ſpeak of thereſt of Canaan as appears v. 7.8. therefore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7847:31"/>a third reſt is there meant by the Prophet, even the reſt of heaven. If this be compared with the Text, it will be found out of ſquare in three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in that he makes the Sabbath to be a promiſe to the Patriarches, but where doe we finde any ſuch promiſe? Nay how could it be a promiſe, if inſtituted in paradiſe? For a promiſe is of a thing to come, not already in being.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of thoſe reſts, which were given the Iewes, as types and figures of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall reſt: but the Ieſuit affirmes the Sabbath, not to have been given to the Iews, but man kind from the begining; which indeed overthroweth the whole ſcope of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the maine intention of the Apoſtle is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, which is not to explaine the Anagogicall, or heavenly Sabbath, but only the ſpirituall reſt, which the faithfull under the Goſpell receive in Chriſt. The words are plaine, <hi>we which doe believe doe enter into reſt:</hi> nor is the preſent tenſe put for the future, as the Ieſuit ſuggeſts without any ground; For it is the ſin of apoſtacy falling from the faith of Chriſt, againſt which the Apoſtle ſo much laboureth in that place, and throughout the whole Epiſtle; and apoſtacy is a falling away from ſome eſtate, in which we already are. Indeed our ſpirituall reſt, which we finde in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Rev. 21.4.</note> endeth in that heavenly reſt deſcribed <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.4. but this was not firſt, and immediatly typified by the Sabbath, and the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and therefore in a ſecondary, and ſubordinate conſtruction, only to be

Leaving therefore this leſuiticall interpretation to thoſe that like to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; the text is plaine enough, (as<note n="a" place="margin">Praecipua huius loci dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultas hinc provenit, quòd violentèr à multis torque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> one hath well obſerved) to all thoſe, that deſire not to wreſt it: For the Apoſtle exhorts the Hebrews, to whom he writes, to take heed, leaſt by their Apoſtacy they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves of that reſt of God, which he ever propoſed, and promiſed to their Fathers, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth two objections. For they might ſay, we can be in no ſuch danger, having already entred into Gods reſt two manner of waies.</p>
               <p>Firſt into that reſt of his, which was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, when he finiſhed his works; into this the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which he gave our Fathers, as a ſpeciall pledge and badge of his people, hath admitted us. Our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of him is our communication with him.</p>
               <p>To this the Apoſtle anſwereth, that indeed the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was given as a memoriall of Gods reſt, but that this is not the reſt of God, of which the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeakes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are entred into Gods reſt, being brought by <hi>Ioſhua</hi> into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the land of reſt.</p>
               <p>But this plea is alſo rejected by the Apoſtle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>David,</hi> whoſe text is quoted, lived long after <hi>Ioſhua.</hi> The ſumme therefore of that Scripture is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that neither the reſt of the Sabbath, nor the reſt of Canaan was that reſt, into which God promiſed to bring his people, but only types, and ſhadowes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. To conclude, this argument hangs together like
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7847:32"/>a rope of ſands, becauſe the text ſaith, <hi>the works were finiſhed from the foundation,</hi> when God reſted; it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that therefore alſo Adam, and the Patriarches kept a Sabbath from the begining; in which is no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence at all, as any man may ſee.</p>
               <p>To the fourth it is confeſſed, that there was a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath before the Law was given in Sinai; but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not of Sinai, but the wilderneſſe after Iſraels departure out of Egypt, till when we ſay, there was no Sabbath. And whereas it is ſaid, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks thereof in that place, as of a thing well known; he that looks better into the text, ſhall eaſily perceive the contrary. To this purpoſe obſerve theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the occaſion of thoſe words of <hi>Moſes; to morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord;</hi> they are his reply to a relation of a new accident, in the gathering of Mannah, <hi>viz.</hi> that whereas all the weekbefore, whether they gathered more or leſſe, every man had an Omer full, now on the ſixt day e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man gathered two.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this new accident is expounded by a new oracle, or revelation, <hi>this is that, which the Lord hath ſaid,</hi> for ſo the words are uſed v. 16.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what is this new Oracle, but the reaſon of this new accident, God teaching them thereby a new obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Sabbath. For ſurely if the Sabbath had been ſo well known, as is pretended; neither the rulers of the congregation would have wondred ſo much at the double portion of Mannah,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7847:32"/>which fell on the ſixt day; they might eaſily have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to morrow is Gods reſting day; neither nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Moſes</hi> have given them a new oracle for their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we may obſerve the peoples diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for notwithſtanding all this, ſome went out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſeventh day. By this it probably appeares, that they knew not yet what belonged to the keeping of a Sabbath. This was, it ſeemes, the firſt, that they ever heard of; therefore they neither beleeved, nor obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it; whereas afterwards being acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, they kept it even to ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, marke the Lords expoſtulation with them; <hi>how long refuſe you to keep my commandements, and my lawes?</hi> Had he ſpoken in the ſingular number, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>how long,</hi> might have ſeemed to intimate, that the law of the Sabbath had been of greater antiquity; but when the Iſraelites are reproved for breaking the Lords commandements, and lawes; it is ſtill meant of thoſe, which God gave them by <hi>Moſes;</hi> neither can any place be ſhewed to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, we may note, that God doth only reprove, not puniſh this violation; whereas afterwards, when the Sabbath was known, and eſtabliſhed, the gatherer of ſticks muſt be ſtoned; Now what difference, I pray you, between ſtick-gathering and Mannah-gathering; but that the one ſinned of preſumption againſt an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance newly ſetled, and by conſent eſtabliſhed; The other, againſt a law only newly propoſed, and made known, but not fully aſſented unto; And this I am

               <p>Seventhly, the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> are remarkable; <hi>ſee how the Lord hath given you the Sabbath: ſee,</hi> betoken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the novelty of the thing: <hi>how,</hi> ſheweth the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sabbath; <hi>to you,</hi> ſaith the text, not to your Fathers, or to all man kind; To which point the words of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> are ſo plaine, as it is a wonder to me, how any man can imagine a Sabbath commanded before <hi>Moſes.</hi>

                  <hi>Thou madest knowne unto them thine holy Sabbath by the hand of Moſes thy ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, marke the concluſion of the ſtory, <hi>ſo the people reſted on the ſeventh day.</hi> By reaſon of this new accident, new revelation, gentle reproofe, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition were they brought to keep a Sabbath. Vnto all which adde the gloſſe of<note n="c" place="margin">Trem. in locum.</note> 
                  <hi>Iunius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Tremelius,</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there were three cauſes of the Sabbaths inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; the remembrance of the creation, the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of Egypt, and the fall of Mannah. No ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect can precede its cauſe in nature, and time, which the Sabbath needs muſt doe, if it preceded Mannah in obſervation, and yet the fall of Mannah be a cauſe of its inſtitution. It doth not therefore appeare by this Scripture, that the Sabbath was a thing well known, and practiſed at that time. When <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith <hi>it is the holy Sabbath,</hi> the preſent tenſe is put for the future, as is moſt uſuall, when we ſpeak of daies or ſolemnities, though novell, and occaſionall.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:7847:33"/>
               <p>To the <hi>fifth</hi> we ſay, that <hi>Noah,</hi> in ſending, or forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſend forth his Dove, was not guided by any rule of Religion. For I would aske any ſober man, whether, if <hi>Noah</hi> had ſent out the Dove upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, (ſuppoſing a Sabbath to have been in the daies of <hi>Noah</hi>) he had thereby ſinned, in breaking the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath? For if the Sabbath were broken thereby, it muſt be either by the Dove flying on that day, which were too ridiculous: or by <hi>Noahs</hi> letting her out of the Arke; and by this rule, he that ſhould open a caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his houſe to let a bird abroad upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, (for <hi>Noah</hi> did no more) ſhould prophane it; which to affirme, is more then Iewiſh ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <hi>Noah</hi> regarded not the flying of the Dove, only he durſt not doe it on the Sabbath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was his own work; and his thoughts ſhould have been imployed about his worldly eſtate, and condition, which the<note n="d" place="margin">Eſai. 52.</note> Prophet forbids.</p>
               <p>This place of the Prophet we ſhall have fitter oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion hereafter to examine. For the preſent it ſhall ſuffice to remember, that <hi>Noah,</hi> at this time, though he were ſaved from drowning, yet he ſuffered alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the common diſtreſſe of the flood. Was it ſin, think you, for <hi>Noah</hi> to think upon this calamity on the ſeventh day; or to labour to know, how neere God had ſet a period to that miſery? If a man were at ſea, where, or in what part of the world he knew not, would you hold him guilty of prophaneſſe, if he ſhould goe about to diſcry the land upon the Sabbath day? But what other reaſon can be given of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7847:34"/>days expectation, which is thus noted in the text.</p>
               <p>Some perhaps will ſay, becauſe ſeven is the number of perfection, that <hi>Noah</hi> might have conceived, that God would compleat his Iudgement, and make dry the earth upon ſome ſeventh day: or, that knowing, that God made the world in ſeven daies of nothings, he might hope that he would new make it againe, as it were, out of the flood in ſome ſuch time.</p>
               <p>But for mine owne part, I doe not conceive, that the obſervation of numbers was yet extant; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>Noah</hi> was directed hereunto, by the change of the Moone in every ſeven daies; well<note n="a" place="margin">He reſolved to open the windowes, or flood-gates of heaven, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtrength of influence to the ſtarres. Bolton.</note> knowing that the element of water is moſt ſubject to this Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, as experience ſheweth. And there is no doubt to be made, but that, as God did miraculouſly both powre downe the flood, and withdraw it: ſo in both works he uſed the help of ſecond cauſes, and ſtrengthned the naturall influences of thoſe heavenly bodies. This reaſon therefore doth no way conclude.</p>
               <p>To the ſixt, which is the place of <hi>Iob.</hi> underſtanding, by the <hi>ſons of God, Iob,</hi> and his children, and <hi>their ſtanding before the Lord,</hi> their keeping of the Sabbath; If it be the interpretation of <hi>Pineda</hi> the Ieſuit, I think it is a ſingular phantaſy of his owne. But to give <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neda</hi> his due, although he ſeeme to ſay, that this ſence may be gathered out of the ſeptuagint; yet he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe affirmes, that by <hi>the ſons of God,</hi> in that place, are meant the holy Angels; and proves, by many reaſons borrowed from<note n="b" place="margin">Ex quibus omnibus effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, vt qui fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7847:34"/>God doth more often agree to the Angels, then to men, in holy Scripture. This argument therefore, as it is forſaken of reaſon, ſo alſo of authority; only we may note by the way, that <hi>Iob</hi> offered ſacrifice for his children every day, not upon any one ſet day more religiouſly obſerved, then another.</p>
               <p>To the ſeventh, be it granted, that time hath ever been divided by weeks, notwithſtanding ſome ſay, that, before Iſraels coming out of Egypt, we find no mention of them at all in Scripture. But that there ſhould be no ſuch diviſion of time without the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day Sabbath, hath no ground of reaſon. For look how time came to be meaſured by quarters, and months, which was by the Sun and Moon ſet for that purpoſe in the heavens: ſo likewiſe by weeks. And therefore I make no queſtion, but that the heathen, who never heard of a ſeventh-day Sabbath, have weeks, as well as months, and years. For men doe naturally obſerve the courſe of thoſe great lights, and by the revolution of the Sunne recken their yeares, &amp; by the Moone their Months: Now the ſubdiviſion of the moneth into weeks is chalked out unto them, by the foure changes of the Moone. This argument therefore ſeemeth to ſuppoſe that, which is againſt the light of nature, <hi>viz.</hi> that men firſt began to divide time by weeks, and ſo adding week unto week, made up the yeare; whereas they are naturally taught firſt to accompt months, and yeares, and afterwards to ſubdivide theſe into weeks, Laſtly, this argument ſuppoſeth, that Adam obſerved the next day after his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7847:35"/>creation for a Sabbath, which I ſuppoſe few will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, ſure I am, none can prove.</p>
               <p>To the eight, be it granted, that God never failes in neceſſaries, that the points of faith, and hope mentioned in the argument, were behoovefull inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Adam, and the Patriarches: that they are alſo included in the ordinance of the Sabbath; but that they are only ſhut up in this ordinance, or that <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Fathers before the law, learned them not elſe where; is no way to be yeclded. For they might have them (as queſtionles they had) both by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of revelation. By naturall light; for we muſt not think, that Adam utterly loſt the knowledge of his Creator, or works of creation; he knew after his fall<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 3.12.</note>

               <p>To the ninth we ſay, the Patriarches no doubt did publikely worſhip God; their altars and ſacrifices make it manifeſt; neither was it any will-worſhip in them, but appointed by revelation. From hence to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7847:35"/>clude, that therefore God appointed them the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, is no good conſequent; for God appoints men many duties, but preſcribeth no certaine time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. For time is no part of the worſhip, but an accident, and adjunct thereof, left for the moſt part to diſcretion, and opportunity. I hope, that no man will deny, but that God is publikely worſhipped amongſt us upon Holy-daies, Wedneſdaies, and Frydaies; and yet God never ſets us thoſetimes. From the worſhip thereof to inferre the time, is no good deduction. But let all be granted, that God both preſcribed worſhip, and time; the Sabbath at moſt is but a poſitive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, as the ſacrifices alſo were, no morall duty, which is the thing aimed at in this queſtion, and ſhall be handled in that which followeth.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the teſtimonies of the learned are not, and, as I conceive, cannot be very many; and thoſe that are, may eaſily be reconciled. To begin with <hi>Philo,</hi> the very addition which is given him, that he is a <hi>Iew,</hi> is ſufficient exception againſt his teſtimony. And ſo for M. <hi>Broughton;</hi> it may be reputed a part of his <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binicall</hi> learning, to which he was ſo much addicted. M. <hi>Calvin</hi> is not conſtant to himſelfe in this point; for in his book of<note n="a" place="margin">Perpetuam iſlam ceſſatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Iudaeis repraeſentahat unius diei ex ſeptem obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatio <hi>Cal. inſt. l. 2.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>

                  <hi>CAP. V.</hi> The ſecond queſtion is propoſed, whether the letter of the fourth Commandement be a morall precept?</head>
               <p>A Law being once enacted, we take into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the binding power thereof; for all lawes doe naturally bind all ſuch, upon whom they are impoſed, untill it doth appeare, that they be repealed. Hence though Critickes ſay, <hi>lex à legendo,</hi> yet Divines take up another Etymology, <hi>lex à liga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do,</hi> its therefore a law, becauſe it doth oblige. But all Lawes being not of the ſame kind, doe not bind after the ſame manner, neither as they are lawes, nor as they are intended by the lawgivers. This is moſt true not only of humane lawes, whoſe authors are men, but of ſuch alſo as proceed immediatly from God himſelfe. For there be ſome lawes of his, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige all people, nations, and languages upon the face of the whole earth, even every ſon of <hi>Adam.</hi> Others of them are preſcribed either to particular perſons, or ſome one people, &amp; nation only: ſome of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are of perpetuall, and everlaſting continuance, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be revoked; others were ordained only for a certaine period of time. Lawes of the firſt kind are properly ſtiled <hi>morall,</hi> which are in both the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med reſpects univerſall, the dictates of nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the divine eſſence, which is not ſubject to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7847:36"/>ſhadow of change; Lawes of the latter kind are all the ceremoniall, and judiciall ordinances. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond queſtion therefore is, whether the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Decalogue be a morall law, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all men throughout all ages to the end of the world: or whether it were given only to the Iſraelites, till the fulneſſe of time, and exhibiting of the Meſſiah? The affirmative ſeems to ſome men as cleer as the day it ſelfe, and to be a point of that high conſequence in religion, as that we ought rather to ſuffer as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, then to quit this truth. We will therefore mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter up all ſuch arguments, as make to this purpoſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="chapter">
               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The arguments for the affirmative are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and enforced.</head>
               <p>ANd <hi>firſt,</hi> it is alleadged, that all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Decalogue are morall, being parts, and branches of the law of nature. But the fourth commandement is one of theſe, placed in the very heart of the reſt, ſpoken by Gods owne mouth, written by Gods own finger, and that in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſtone, to teach us their perpetuity, laid up with the reſt in the Arke; therefore the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement muſt needs be morall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if this be not morall, as well as any of the reſt, not only <hi>Moſes,</hi> but God himſelfe, who pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it ſo, might ſeeme purpoſely to confound things
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7847:37"/>of different natures, intending as it were to breed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions in the Church, as we ſee at this day. But this is no way to be imagined, for God is the author of peace, and not confuſion; therefore doubtleſſe the fourth commandement is equally morall with all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that which is naturally written upon the hearts of the very heathen themſelves, muſt needs be morall; but the whole fourth commandement is thus naturally written. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt the Sabbath muſt be the ſeventh day; for this number was ever reputed the number of perfection, and the holy number, not only<note n="a" place="margin">Cyprian, de Spiritu S.</note> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſo cals it, but <hi>Homer</hi> alſo, <hi>Heſiod</hi> and <hi>Callimachus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the whole day was ſpent even by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens after an holy manner, in publique worſhip, and private contemplation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they alſo obſerved their Sabbaths with ſevere ſtrictneſſe from all manner of works. Their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous Prieſts affirmed, that the holy daies were polluted, if any work were done in them; By all which it is plaine, that the very Heathen obſerved the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath not by revelation, for this they never had, but by the very light of nature; therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that commandement is moral, which hath all the characters of morality, As <hi>firſt,</hi> that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaines to all nations in all ages. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the more underſtanding amongſt the Heathen appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and taught it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that it may be diſcerned by reaſon rightly informed. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that it containes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7847:37"/>ſomething which is neceſſary to humane nature to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine its end, and finall happineſſe. <hi>Fiftly, that it is ſuch,</hi> as if it were obſerved with the reſt, would make the converſation of man compleat, without the addition of any other law; but all theſe markes of morality are to be ſeen in the fourth commandement. The two firſt are apparent by the precedent argument; for it was ever obſerved, approved, and taught by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in all ages. The third is a neceſſary conſequent of the former, for if the Heathens obſerved it, this their obſervation muſt needs proceed from reaſon rightly informed. The fourth no man can be ſo wicked as to deny; for if any thing be neceſſary to bring men unto everlaſting happineſſe, it is the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Sabbath. The laſt alſo is evident, for if all the reſt of the Decalogue together with this were obſerved, what need we any other lawes either of God, or man? <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, that commandement is morall, whoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are morall; but ſuch are the reaſons in the fourth commandement. <hi>As the firſt,</hi> which is taken from the equity of the law, giving men ſixe for one; for God ever was, and ever will be alike liberall to all men in all ages in this kind. <hi>The ſecond,</hi> drawn from Gods intereſt in the ſeventh day. <hi>The Seventh is the Sabbath of the Lord,</hi> and what ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from giving God his owne? <hi>The third,</hi> is Gods example propoſed for our imitation; for all men are bound by the very light of nature, <hi>to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of God, as deare children. The fourth,</hi> is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7847:38"/>which is made therein; For it will be as bleſſed a day, or a day as full of bleſſing unto us, if we ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify it, as ever it was to the Iews; God being not leſſe good, nor his grace leſſe powerfull, nor his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe leſſe ſure; The fift, is the eaſe &amp; refreſhing of our ſervants, and beaſts, to whom Chriſtians muſt not be leſſe mercifull, then the Iews. Laſtly the Sabbath taught them, that they were the Lords people: and no man will ſay, but that we alſo are ſo, by as many and by more ſtrong tyes, and relations, then were ever any. <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, the law Ceremoniall, and Iudiciall were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven only to the Iewes, and ſuch as were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but the fourth commandement was directed, not only to thoſe within the covenant, but alſo to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and aliens. <hi>The ſtrangers within thy gates.</hi> And upon this ground<note n="a" place="margin">Neh. 13.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Nehemiah</hi> reproved the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Merchants, which were ſtrangers; therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, from the words of Chriſt in the Goſpell,<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 24.20.</note> 
                  <hi>pray that your flight be not on the Sabbath day;</hi> Thoſe words were ſpoken to the diſciples, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewing, that if their flight ſhould happen to befall them on the Sabbath; their affliction would thereby be increaſed. But if the fourth commandement be not Morall, what addition of ſorrow had it been, if their flight had befallen them that day? Chriſtians (and ſuch were the diſciples) need not trouble themſelves about a law Ceremoniall. Thus then. That comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, the breaking whereof might juſtly grieve a Chriſtian forced thereunto by flight, is doubtleſſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7847:38"/>morall, but the fourth commandement is ſuch, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Eightly, that commandement, againſt which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane corruptions doe eſpecially ariſe, and band them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves both in the Godly, and the wicked, muſt needs be morall: but our corruptions doe chiefly fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sabbath, as the Godly feele by experience in themſelves: and experience doth alſo make evident in the wicked of the world; therefore <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly, that cannot be a truth of God, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowes all religion, lets in Atheiſme, Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiſme, and all prophaneſſe; no good tree can bring forth ſuch evill fruit. But that doctrine, which denieth the morality of the Sabbath, overthroweth all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lets in Epicureiſme, and Prophaneſſe; as appeares in thoſe Churches, wherein it is taught in forraine parts. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenthly, that wich the Church of England teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in her Homilies, ought to be held for truth by all the obedient children of that Church; but the morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sabbath is that, which the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land teacheth in her Homily of the time, and place of prayer; as will appeare to every one, that will read the ſame: Therefore all the obedient children of the Church of England ought to acknowledge it to be true.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, if you make the fourth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Ceremoniall, you make the Church of England guilty of Iudaiſme. For that Church, which readeth to her children a Ceremoniall Law, and commands
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7847:39"/>them to kneele, whilſt it is read, in acknowledgment of their ſubjection thereunto; and at the end to pray, <hi>Lord have mercy vpon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law,</hi> cannot but be a Iewiſh Church: But the Church of England thus teacheth her children. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Twelfthly, unleſſe the fourth commandement be morall, there will be but nine commandements in the Decalogue, which is contrary not only to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved opinion of all men, but to the calculation of the whole Catholique Church in all ages, and is no meane Sacriledge to affirme. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, that which is taught by men, which are moſt ſpirituall, and <hi>alone diſcerne the things of God,</hi> muſt needs be true, and ſo on the contrary. But the Morality of the Sabbath is taught by men that are moſt ſpirituall, the contrary by men that are carnall, therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we have the authority of all our Engliſh writers almoſt ever ſince the reformation unto this time; neither was it hitherto ever contradicted for at leaſt theſe threeſcore, and ten yeares, unleſſe by Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, or Familiſts. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

               <p>THe negative tenent hath alſo its arguments, which in the next place muſt be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is alleadged; That commandement, over which Chriſt was abſolute Lord, as he was the ſonne of man, is not morall; for a morall precept is part of Gods eternall law, over which the ſonne of man can have no power, being made under the law: But Chriſt, as the ſonne of man, <hi>was Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon two ſundry occaſions hath twice told us <hi>Math.</hi> 12. <hi>Mark.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>To theſe Texts theſe exceptions have been made.</p>
               <p n="1">1<note place="margin">Excep. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> That this phraſe doth no more import the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to be a ceremony, then the ſame uſed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth conclude the dead, and the living to be a ceremony, <hi>for he roſe againe, that he might be the Lord of the dead, and of the living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is to play with the ambiguity of the word; it's one thing to be Lord of the Church, to guide, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne, perfect, quicken, raiſe, glorify her: for this is the meaning of the Apoſtle, upon which that in the <hi>Epheſians</hi> may ſeeme as a comment. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20.21.22. And another thing to be Lord of the Law or conſtitution, to moderate, diſpence, order, alter, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7847:40"/>for in what other conſtruction can any one be ſaid to be Lord of a law?</p>
               <p n="2">2<note place="margin">Except. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> It is ſaid, that Chriſt did not intend by theſe words of his any ſuch Lordſhip, becauſe he did not then abrogate the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Nor is this to the purpoſe, for never any man yet dreamed, that Chriſt did in thoſe words aboliſh the Sabbath; for both it, and the reſt of the legall ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were in force, till they were nailed with him to the Croſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3<note place="margin">Except. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> It is excepted, that our Saviour in thoſe words doth only diſpence with his Diſciples in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſe, and challenge to himſelfe the power, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of expounding the Law againſt the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, who pretended only to the Chayre, and to give interpretations of the Law.</p>
               <p>But to ſatisfy this alſo, and to cleare the Text, we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,</p>
               <p n="1">1 That Chriſt doth not there, or in any other place, ever diſpence with the law in himſelfe, or any other, for he <hi>took upon him the form of a ſervant, and came not to break the Law, but to fulfill it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 That in thoſe words Chriſt doth not intend to expound the law only; for this he had done before, by the example of <hi>David,</hi> and by the place in <hi>Hoſea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 That he doth therefore begin a new argument againſt the Phariſees, conſiſting of two things; the firſt of the end, and intention of the Law, which was the good of man; the other from his own office, which was to be head both of men, and Angels, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7847:40"/>therefore being to diſpoſe of all things, which tended unto mans good.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That he intended by thoſe words to rectify their ſuperſtitious conceits of the Sabbath. As if he had ſaid, you magnify the Sabbath, as if it were one of the greateſt of all the commandements, a maine end of mans creation; but you muſt know, that it was made for man, and not man for it, as were all the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall rites, and ceremonies. And if this be ſo, I, that am the Meſſiah, am by my office Lord of the Sabbath, and can, and will abrogate the ſame in due time. And that this abrogation of the law of the Sabbath was that, which our Saviour did there at leaſt inſinuate unto them, is plaine; if we compare the text with that other of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where he tels them, that he is greater then the Temple, having abſolute juriſdiction,<note n="a" place="margin">Templum Sabbatho ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viebat, ipſe autem domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus erat Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathi. <hi>Mald. in locum.</hi>
                  </note> and Lordſhip over all Legall, and Moſaicall rites.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that, for which, no man is to be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and condemned, is not a Morall Law; for the Law of nature teacheth us to condemne the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of all Morall precepts; but no man is to be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or condemned for the Sabbath.<note n="b" place="margin">Col. 2.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16.</p>
               <p>If any man ſay, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feaſts of the Iewes, which alſo are called Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, not of the ſeventh-day Sabbath in the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
               <p>I anſwere. Firſt, that he contradicts all Ancient, and Moderne expoſitions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that in all other places of Scripture, where mention is made of their Sabbaths, the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7847:41"/>Sabbath is alſo included. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 20.33. <hi>Eſai.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 2.11. why not here?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle had reaſon to have excepted this eſpecially, conſidering that his doctrine in that place is a doctrine of liberty; for in caſes of this nature unleſſe men have their bounds ſet them, they eaſily turne their lawfull, and warrantable liberty into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable licentiouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is not likely, nor agreeable to any rule, that, when all, which are denominated, are expreſſed, (as Sabbaths) that which doth denominate, (<hi>viz.</hi> the weekly Sabbath) ſhould be excepted; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the enumeration of the text is ſufficient. <hi>New-moones, Holydaies.</hi> What Ceremoniall feaſts had the Iewes diſtinct from their weekly Sabbath? which ſtands not under one of theſe heads. Either therefore the Apoſtle uſeth tautologies, which is not likely, his diſcourſe being in that place Polemicall:<note n="a" place="margin">Multa feſta habebant Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daei quaedam quotanuis ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrari oporte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, quaedam ineunte quoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet menſe, quaedam fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis ſeptima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, ut Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia tanguntur ab Apoſtolo, hoc in loco. <hi>Salisbut, in locum.</hi>
                  </note> Or that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partite enumeration of <hi>new-moones, holy daies, Sabbath daies</hi> includeth alſo the weekly Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the weekly Sabbath, which the Iewes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and circumciſion, were the two maine heads of Iudaiſme, for which in thoſe times the Seducers ſo much contended: therefore this weekly Sabbath is there eſpecially to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that, <hi>which is a ſhadow of good things to come, whoſe body was Chriſt,</hi> cannot be a morall law; for morall duties are eternall verities, no fleeting and vaniſhing ſhadowes. But the Sabbath in the fourth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7847:41"/>Commandement was ſuch <hi>a ſhadow of good things to come;</hi> As hath in part appeared by that place of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. and ſhall be farther evidenced in that which followes, and hath generally been taught by all<note n="a" place="margin">Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, that, which cannot be deduced out of the principles of naturall reaſon rightly informed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out revelation, cannot be Morall: But the ſanctifying of the Sabbath, as it is ſet downe in the letter of the fourth commandement, cannot be ſo deduced.

God by prerogative royall over all create beings may call for any mans life by the hands of whom he pleaſeth, as in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> caſe. He may likewiſe deprive any man of his propriety in any of his goods, and ſo give them as a prey to another, as in <hi>Iſraels</hi> caſe; But God cannot change the matter of other Commandements, as make himſelfe more Gods then one, or worthy to be diſhonoured. So then in the forenamed particulars there was no diſpenſation in the commandement, but an alteration in the things. And the reaſon of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is plaine; for had the Egyptians continued the lawfull owners of their Iewels, and ray ment, the Iſraelites muſt have been theeues, keeping them from them without their conſents.

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> In which the queſtion is ſtated, and explained.</head>
               <p>THe Morality of the letter of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is thus eagerly maintained even with way wardneſſe, to make way only to that which concernes the Lords day; of which we will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſpeak (God willing) in its place. For there being neither precept, nor practice in the Scripture, nor any other good record for that, which hath of late yeares been imperiouſly thruſt upon the conſciences of men in that point: the broachers of thoſe doctrines were of neceſſity to ſhelter themſelves under the letter of the fourth Commandement; And indeed this hiding place being once granted them, we could never be <hi>Iewiſh</hi> enough in Sabbatizing. But if it be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that this is but a pretence only, and a covering of Fig-leaves; the nakedneſſe of their doctrine will ſoon be ſeen: and that they have (though unawares) laid ſnares, and ginnes for mens conſciences therein. For the opening now of this point, we muſt firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what a <hi>Morall law is?</hi> And then, how <hi>the fourth Commandement is Morall,</hi> and <hi>how not?</hi> Laſtly, what be <hi>the particular Ceremonies therein contained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Morall is derived<note n="a" place="margin">Moralus ſunt de illis, quae ſecundum ſe ad honos mores perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; cum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem humani mores dicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in ordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> from <hi>Mores,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>manners:</hi> That therefore in a large and generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the word may be ſaid to be a Morall law, which doth any way preſcribe concerning the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7847:46"/>of men. Now the manners of men being good, or evill, as they either agree, or diſagree with right reaſon, a Morall Law is that, which preſcribeth a man to governe himſelfe, as right reaſon neither blinded nor corrupted doth require. Hence it is, that the Law Morall, is the Law Naturall; for that only is right reaſon not corrupted, which God imprinted in the heart of manin the creation with an indeleble chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter never to be blotted out. And therefore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques thereof remaine ever ſince the fall of Adam in the worſt of the heathen. This kind of law is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in force, though it never be proclaimed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it commandeth thoſe things, that are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſimply good, and forbids thoſe things, which are of themſelves ſimply evill. Yet becauſe it was much obſcured in mans heart, the fall of Adam making us the children of darkneſſe; God was pleaſed to give a copy thereof in writing to his people, and in them to his whole Church for ever; The Morall law therefore, of which we ſpeak in this place, in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and reſtrained ſence, is not every rule of right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but only that, which is naturally engraven upon the conſcience. So that the Schooles have well diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the rules of right reaſon into three kinds.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there be ſome ſo common and obvious, as that man, retaining humane reaſon, cannot erre in them: as that God is to be loved; good to be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; evill to be avoided; and ſuch like practicall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>ex terminis evidentia;</hi> and all concluſions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, and immediatly flowing from the ſame
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7847:46"/>And ſo Morall (ſaith<note n="b" place="margin">Non omnia decalogi prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta ſunt de lege naturae ſtrictè accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tà. <hi>lib. 3. ſent. diſt. 37. q. 1. art. 2. con. 1.</hi> Duo praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta negativa primae tabulae ſunt de lege naturae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priè <hi>

                  </note> the firſt and ground of all the reſt, that <hi>there is a God;</hi> thoſe practicall concluſions are known of themſelves without farther teaching. Lawes thus Morall are utterly undiſpenſable even by God himſelfe, who cannot deny himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſome of theſe rules and directions of manners are not ſo obvious, and manifeſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet ſuch, as every vulgar and mean capacity may eaſily find out even by the light of nature: as that <hi>parents are to be honoured:</hi> that <hi>God is publikely to be worſhipped,</hi> with<note n="d" place="margin">Secundae ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulae praecepta ſunt de lege naturae non ſtrictè, ſed lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gè accepta. <hi>Biel ib. con 3.</hi>
                  </note> the precepts of the ſecond table. Theſe are not ſo plaine, and evident, as the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and therefore men doe the more eaſily erre in them, as we ſee by the practice both of heathens, and of the ignorant Chriſtians. Theſe may in particular caſes be diſpenſed with,<note n="e" place="margin">Non rapie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant alienum, quia Deus erat ſuperior, &amp; verus Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus omnium bonorum Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypti, &amp; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius univer ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, &amp; ita poterit tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium infilios Iſrael. <hi>Biel. ib. Dub. 4.</hi>
                  </note> by changing the nature of the things, about which they are converſant, as hath already been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſome of the rules of right reaſon, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens actions, are yet more dark, and obſcure then the former; and therefore are known only to wiſe men, or by revelation; Such are all good poſitive lawes ſuperadded to thoſe of the decalogue, either by God, or man; and may be ſtiled <hi>Reſponſa pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> the anſwers of the wiſe. In this laſt and largeſt conſtruction of Morall, all the Holy rites preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7847:47"/>by <hi>Moſes,</hi> being appendices to the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; and all the Iudicials appendices to the ſeverall precepts of the firſt, and ſecond table may be termed Morall. The queſtion therefore is not of this kind of Morality, but of the two former only, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the law of the Sabbath be either a principle in nature known, and evident of it ſelfe: or at leaſt ſuch, as every man, that hath the uſe of pure naturall reaſon, may without revelation eaſily find out? For that it is under poſitive precept in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement was never doubted.</p>
               <p>We muſt in the next place underſtand, how we ſpeak of the fourth commandement in this queſtion; whether of the whole, and every part thereof, or of one, or more parts, and clauſes?</p>
               <p>And firſt, there are, that ſay, that according to the law of God, and rules of right reaſon, there ought not to be in the time of the Goſpell any diſtinction of daies, as being directly contrary to Chriſtian liberty. So our <hi>Anabaptiſts, Perfestists, Libertines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other ſide there are, that affirme every letter and Syllable therein to be Morall: as the lews; and ſuch Chriſtians, as in this particular doe Iudaize expreſly, as the Familiſts, and others, together with our rigid Sabbatharians, who although they ſtand not for that very day, of which the commandement ſpeaketh, the ſeventh from the creation, as the others; yet keep the Lords day, as being a ſeventh intended alſo in the commandement, and to be obſerved in all things according to the ſound of the letter by all men
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7847:47"/>in all ages; which is no better then implicit <hi>Iudaiſme.</hi> And herein they ſtand (for ought I know) alone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they will claime kindred of the ancient Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, the Ebionites.</p>
               <p>There are others in the third place, that affirme, the fourth commandement to be partly Morall, partly Ceremoniall. And this is the moſt generall voice of Divines, ancient, and moderne, Proteſtants, Papiſts, Lutherans, Calviniſts; except thoſe before named.</p>
               <p>But this their agreement is not without great diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement; ſome affirming in one ſence, &amp; ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſome of more, ſome of fewer branches of the commandement.</p>
               <p>Many in the Popiſh Schoole, with ſome Proteſtants, eſpecially Lutherans, put morality in two clauſes; the firſt is, <hi>Remember thou keep holy the reſting day,</hi> where a day is commanded (ſay<note n="g" place="margin">Morale eſt ſanctificare unum è ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. <hi>Baldvv. c. de Sab. caſu 2.</hi> Manet hoc morale, eſſe nimirum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod tempus, vel diem ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quem ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis ſeptimanis ad exercitia divina pera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radus Diete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus dom. 17. poſt Trin.</hi> Morale eſt, quod ſacra re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies die ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminatè hoc vel illo, ſed u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no è ſeptem piè obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da eſt. <hi>Thum. in expl.

                  </note> they) in generall. They ſecond is, <hi>the ſeventh is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God,</hi> wherein (ſay they) the former generality is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and determined to be one of ſeven.</p>
               <p>But<note n="k" place="margin">Evaneſcant nugae pſeudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prophetarum, qui Iudaic â opinione po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oribus ſaeculis imbuerunt, nihil aliud aſſerentes, niſi abrogatum eſſe quod caeremoniale erat in hoc mandato, id vocant ſu â linguâ ſeptimae diei taxationem, remanere vero quod morale eſt, nempe unius diei obſervationem in hebdomade, <hi>Calv. inſtit. lib. 2. c. 8.</hi>

                  <hi>Calvin,</hi> and all thoſe that inſiſt in his ſteps flye from this as from falſe doctrine, and Iudaiſme, I meane this latter aſſertion; for they joyne with them in the former, and acknowledge a morality for a ſet day; but ſay they, the determination to one in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or five, or ten, &amp;c. is wholy arbitrary, and in the power of the Church to preſcribe. And herein <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:7847:48"/>hath the voices of many both Papiſts, and Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans. One thing more muſt be added, that when Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines put morality in the firſt clauſe <hi>(Remember thou keep holy the reſting day)</hi> thoſe words may undergoe a twofold conſideration; for they may be taken</p>
               <p>Either formally, as they lye in the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thus conſidered they are not Morall; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſpeak of that particular Sabbath given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iewes, even the day of Gods reſt. It is not <hi>á Sabbath,</hi> but <hi>thé Sabbath,</hi> even that which God ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and is pretended to have been as ancient as Adam. The Sabbath muſt be the ſame with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, or elſe there is no tolerable ſence, or congruity in that Law.</p>
               <p>Or <hi>Materially,</hi> as challenging a tribute of our time; As if it ſaid, put a part ſome certaine, and ſet time from thine own employments for Gods publike worſhip; and in this ſence<note n="m" place="margin">Hoceſt quod uſitatè &amp; rectè dicitur, novum teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum non genus, quod morale eſt, ſed ſpeciem, quae caeremonialis eſt, abrogâſſe. <hi>Chem. part. 4. exam.</hi> Morale eſt quant ùm ad hoc, quo l ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo leputet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquod tempus vitae ſuae ad vacandu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis. <hi>Aq. 2.2.</hi> ae q. <hi>122. art. 4. in corpore.</hi> Feſta quoàd genus inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta ſunt, quoad ſpeciem ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in liber â poteſtate Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae. <hi>Bald. c. de Sab.

                  </note> they affirme it to be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and not otherwiſe. That God therefore muſt have ſome of our time allotted out for his publike ſervice, is the ſubſtance of that commandement, to continue for ever unto the worlds end.

                  <hi>Theodoret</hi> alſo ſaith, that many other nations communicated with the Iewes in circumciſion; and we know it to be true at this day in Turkes, and Mahumetanes. But the Iewes alone even unto this day obſerved a Sabbath, as the only proper ſeale of Gods covenant. Laſtly, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is obſerved to have joyned the Sabbath with circumciſion, as being both of like nature, and uſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Character of ceremonies is, that they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7847:50"/>ſerved to mind the people of their naturall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; This we ſee in all their waſhings, cleanſings, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſyings; ſacrifices, therefore called alſo <hi>expiations.</hi> The ſame like wiſe did their feaſts, and new Moones repreſent unto them, ſome more, ſome leſſe. And this alſo did the reſt of the Sabbath; For as circumciſion remembred them of the ſuperfluity of malitiouſneſſe to be done away by the circumciſion of the ſpirit: ſo did the reſt of the Sabbath mind them of their prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to follow their ſinfull luſts, walking in their own waies, and of their averſneſſe from ſuffering God to dwell, and raigne amongſt them. This alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears out of that, which hath already been ſaid; for being a ſigne and repreſentation of their covenant with the Lord, it not only remembred them of<note n="a" place="margin">Vt ſcilicèt ludaei ſeirent, non aliter vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam ſuam poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Deo prohari, niſi rationem, conſilia, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus omnes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis exuerent. Calv. in Exod.</note> what he required of them, but alſo of their own crooked diſpoſitions thereunto. It appears alſo by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets expoſtulation with his people to this purpoſe, for <hi>ſeeking their owne wills, doing their own works, and ſpeaking their own words;</hi> for by theſe things cannot be underſtood ordinary works, thoughts, words at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times lawfull; as is commonly expounded, to the entangling of weak conſciences.</p>
               <p>For firſt, though the commandement forbad them ordinary works, and their very ſitting ſtill was a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths duty, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter; yet to ſpeak common words in ordinary communication, or to think of any ordinary things, as occaſion required, was never forbidden.</p>
               <p>If any man ſay, that the other negative precepts
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7847:50"/>take in alſo the heart, and the tongue, and therefore that this alſo in the Sabbath muſt be ſo extended.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that all other negative precepts are of things ſimply, and in their own natures evill; To kill with the tongue by ſlandering, and railing; ſo to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the heart by malice, envy, hatred, evill wiſhes, are things in their own nature ſimply evill; and therefore no marvaile if in this caſe negative commandements thus enlarge themſelves; it is not ſo here.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this interpretation croſſeth the maine ſcope of the Prophet, which is, to diſcover the deep hypocriſy of their hearts, not any outward viſible prophanation of the Sabbath; As if the Prophet ſhould have ſaid, the Lord hath ſent me to cry aloud againſt your deep diſſembling with him in two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall points, the one of faſting, the other<note n="b" place="margin">Eſaias hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritas ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurgat, quod in externo tantum ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandi ritu in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The third character of Ceremonies is, that they repreſented unto them that inward, and ſpirituall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which God requires of them that fear him. So unleavened bread ſignified ſincerity, truth and the like. This alſo is plaine in the Sabbath, repreſenting unto them the inward repoſe, which we ought to have in the Lord, denying of our ſelves, cruciſying our carnall wills, and affections, ſuffering the Lord wholy to governe our hearts by his holy ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Sabbath was a viſible Sermon of the glad tidings of the Goſpell; of that reſt, which Chriſt ſhould bring us; of reconciliation with God; of peace of conſcience through the powerfull operation of a true and lively faith.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7847:51"/>which (I think) it is manifeſt, that the Sabbath was not only a Type, or figure, as the brazen Serpent: as many of their Iudges, Prieſts, Kings, Prophets alſo were, (for this is that, which is replyed) but properly and truly a Leviticall ſhadow, and ceremony aboliſhed in Chriſt the <hi>true Sabbath indeed,</hi> as<note n="h" place="margin">Epiph: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra hereſi lib. <hi>1.</hi> Tom. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>30.</hi>

                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſtiles him.</p>
               <p>To proceed therefore, if the reſt commanded in the Sabbath were thus a figure of our ſpirituall reſt in Chriſt; then doubtleſſe alſo that proportion of reſt, which is the ſtrictneſſe of Sabbathizing according to the ſound of the letter, ſhadowed unto them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of holy and ſpirituall reſt, which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of his redeemed ones, and unto which Chriſt will at laſt bring them by degrees. The Iewes, we know, were forbidden all kinds of ſervile works, even the kindling of fires, and that upon paine of death: I confeſſe, ſome are of opinion, that this was but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary injunction, during Iſraels abode in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe: Their reaſon is, becauſe our Saviour dined (ſaith the Text) with a chiefe Phariſee upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; and it is probable, ſo great a man entertained ſo great a perſonage with a great feaſt, which could not be without kindling of fires. But I cannot conceive, that any Moſaicall ceremony once inſtituted could be aboliſhed, till they were altogether nailed to the croſſe; eſpecially having reference to any benefit, which the faithfull receive from Chriſt; as hath this of the Sabbath. Now though the Iews reſt were ſo ſtrict, and exact, yet we may juſtly wonder at the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7847:52"/>inflicted on the transgreſſors, death; ſince God paſſed over greater things with leſſe cenſures, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and theft, which are contrary to the Law, and light of nature it ſelfe.<note n="i" place="margin">Niſi eximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um aliquid, &amp; ſingulare fuiſſet in Sabbatho, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deri poſſet ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua atrocius iubere homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem interfici, tantùm quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam ligna deciderat. Calv. in Exod.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> therefore ſaith right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that unleſſe there were ſome excellent, and ſingular thing in the Sabbath, more then is expreſſed in the letter, it might ſeeme to ſavour of cruelty to put a man to death for gathering a few ſticks, and kindling a fire with ſticks already gathered. But ſaith he, what was this great and excellent thing in the Sabbath? Doubtleſſe not the litterall reſt; for then the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould continue ſtill the ſame, and the preciſe obſervation of this reſt ought to remaine. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the myſtery, that is ſo excellent and highly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Lord, <hi>viz.</hi> that the faithfull ſhould ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy unto him an<note n="k" place="margin">Sabbathum commendatum eſt priori po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo in otio corporali tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraliter, ut ſigura eſſet ſanctificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis in requiem ſpiritus ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti Aug. ad Ian. ep. <hi>119.</hi>

               <p>If therefore the propoſition be of the ſounds and ſyllables of the Decalogue, ſo that whatſoever is written in the letter thereof is affirmed to be Morall, it is utterly untrue.

If any ſay theſe words are a preface, no law, he ſpeaketh nothing to the purpoſe; for the propoſition in queſtion is univerſall, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is written in the tables of ſtone with Gods own finger; Beſides give us liberty to exclude from being morall, whatſoever is not a law: and thereby the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the fourth Commandement will be denied Morality; for the reaſons of any Law are no more the law it ſelfe, then the preface thereof: Indeed there is an implicit Morality in that preface, Egypt being a type of the Kingdom of Sathan, the houſe of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, the dominion of ſinne; and under the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of theſe are contained the reſt of Gods mercies to his Church; If ſuch a morality as this be all they ſeek for in the law of the Sabbath, no man (I preſume) will gainſay them herein. But to give an other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, what ſhall we think of that clauſe in the fifth commandement, <hi>That thy daies may be long in the land which thy Lord thy God giveth thee?</hi> I am ſure it is no principle in Nature, nor concluſion flowing from any naturall principle: nature can only ſay, God will bleſſe all dutifull and obedient Children; but that it ſhall be with this, or that particular bleſſing (as this is) nature cannot teach us. Beſides this is only a poſitive and conditionall promiſe, not univerſally and perpetually performed, therefore not Morall. And farther let us conſider not only what is promiſed, but to whom, and it will appeare, that thoſe words concerned<note n="b" place="margin">Nullo modo ad nos poſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare.

               <p>To the third, that this Commandement is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engraven upon the hearts of the Heathen, is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7847:56"/>untrue. And whereas it is ſaid in confirmation thereof, that the Heathens generally admired the number of ſeven, we nothing doubt thereof; but to inferre, that therfore they acknowledged the Sabbath for a naturall law, were too looſe a conſequence. The number of three was (I thinke) in as great eſteem amongſt them, as the number of ſeven; it were a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull inference, therefore they naturally diſcerned the bleſſed Trinity. The like may be ſaid of the number of ten, may we therefore ſay, they knew there were ten commandements? It is true, that<note n="g" place="margin">Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexand. Strom. lib. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus</hi> brings many authorities out of <hi>Homer, Heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, Callimachus,</hi> to prove, that the very Heathen knew the ſeventh day was to be kept holy; But how? As Naturall, and Morall? Nothing leſſe; but to ſhew, that the wiſeſt of the Heathens were theeves of holy things, having ſtolne them out of <hi>Moſes</hi> writings, for theſe they had tranſlated: Or Iſraels practice, and this is the maine ſcope of that place alleaged out of the fift book of his <hi>Stromata;</hi> and therefore he doth not only inſtance in the ſeventh-day <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but in the article of the Trinity; the reſurrection of the body, the fire of the laſt day; and the judgement following. Beſides, that the Heathen in all ages gave great heed unto numbers, is confeſſed; But whence? Not from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny light of nature, which directed them; but partly from the deluſions of Sathan in Sorcery, Geomancy, and curious arts: partly from <hi>Pythagorean</hi> ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and partly from their own experiments &amp; obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. To inſiſt a little upon the latter, whence did
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7847:56"/>they admire the number of three? but that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, there were three principles of every naturall body, matter, forme, privation; three kinds of ſoules that informed thoſe bodies, vegetative, ſenſitive, and rationall; three ſorts of good things, which complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the happineſſe both of ſoule and body; three regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſoule like the three regions of the aire; and thus they collected, <hi>tria ſunt omnia,</hi> all things conſiſt of three. The number of ten was alſo in eſteem; and becauſe ten is the greateſt amongſt the unites, they conceited this to be the number of greatneſſe, even to the tenth egge of an hen, and the tenth wave of the Sea.

And that you may think he had great reaſon to call it the <hi>holy number,</hi> he proves it to be ſo from the parts of which it doth conſiſt, foure and three; for three is the number of the holy Trinity, by whom all things were created: and foure the number of the Elements of which they were made, with much more to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But what poore ſpeculations are theſe, to ſway any mans reaſon in a point of Religion, I leave to the judgement of any ſober minded man. It borders upon ſuperſtition, and <hi>Cabaliſticall</hi> Iudaiſme to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of numbers, which the holy Ghoſt hath not commended unto us for myſticall: as the weekes of Daniell, and the number of the beaſt.</p>
               <p>To the fourth, the letter of the Sabbath hath not one, much leſſe all thoſe characters of Morality, which are ſet down; not to queſtion the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. That God ſhould have tribute of our time, for publique worſhip was never by any man denied to be naturall, and morall; but for the determination of one in ſeven, of this one, more then of another,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7847:57"/>that it muſt be a whole naturall day of twenty foure houres, that it muſt be thus and thus obſerved, and all theſe grounded upon Gods reſt at the Creation, hath no character of Morality at all. That the wiſer of the Heathen taught, and practiſed moſt of them, is confeſſed, but as ſtolne amongſt other holy things, as hath been ſhewed. The Law of the Sabbath apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not to all nations; neither did God give it unto mankind in Adam, nor was it ever intended to any but to the Iewes, as an eſpeciall pledge to diſtinguiſh them from other nations. That thoſe things, which are laid down in the letter of the law, are neceſſary dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions unto perfect happineſſe, hath leſſe ground then the former; for let any man ſhew, how the number of ſeven doth guide to happineſſe more then three, five, ten: or to begin the day rather at night, then in the morning: or to doe no manner of work; till this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, this argument concludeth not.</p>
               <p>To the fift, briefly both propoſitions are faulty. The firſt, that whatſoever is backt with a Morall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is a Morall Law; for what think you of the Law of the firſt f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſecond propoſition is alſo faulty; for let the reaſons of the Commandemen be well ſcand, and they will come farre ſhort of that Morality, which is pretended. Aske naturall reaſon at beſt refin'd, what proportions were fit to be obſerved between God and man; would it anſwere, we muſt have ſixe for one? and not rather on the contrary, or any other? what principle of naturall reaſon can guide us to the number of ſix herein; God you ſay hath intereſt in the ſeventh; but this is the queſtion, let this intereſt be diſcovered by naturall light, we will grant the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. All men are as much bound to follow Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in reſting, as the Iewes, but</p>
               <p>Firſt, we deny, that this example of God is, or may be known by the light of Nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it is there propoſed to all men in their generations, being given particularly to the Iews only. For the commandement ſpeaketh not of <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,</hi> but of <hi>that ſeventh</hi> from the creation; wherein the Church followes not Gods example, keeping the firſt of theſe ſeaven. For unleſſe we reſt <hi>that very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,</hi> in which God reſted, we no more reſemble his reſt, then a man that hath a ladder reſembles Iacob, that had a viſion of a ladder. But God hath promiſed a bleſſing unto our reſt, as well as unto theirs, for <hi>the Lord even bleſsed the ſeventh day</hi> to the right obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thereof. But the text is ſtrained, for though God hath promiſed alway to bleſſe his own ordinances, in the publique worſhip; yet for any bleſſedneſſe to be communicated to the day, or affixed to one more
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7847:58"/>then to another, we read not.</p>
               <p>That ſervants and beaſts ſhould now reſt, and be refreſhed, is confeſſed to be Morall; but that they ſhould have reſt upon ſuch, and ſuch a day, juſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny houres from all manner of imployment, was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ceremoniall, partly judiciall, as hath bin ſaid. Which alſo farther appears, becauſe it is added<note n="o" place="margin">Levit. 26.5</note> as a reaſon of the ſeven yeares reſt, which I think no man will ſay was Morall; neither doe I ſee, why the one ſhould not hold as well as the other.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, true it is, that the Sabbath was a token unto them, that they were the Lords people; and that we under the Goſpell are alſo the Lords people is moſt true. But was not Circumciſion alſo a badge unto them, that they were the Lords people: muſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion therefore be Morall, and perpetuali? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. We ſee therefore the vanity of this argument likewiſe.</p>
               <p>To the ſixt, firſt, if by ſtrangers we underſtand all, that are aliens from the commonwealth of Iſraell; plaine it is, that the Sabbath was no more given unto them, then Circumciſion; for it was a ſigne of Gods covenant, and God never covenanted with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Law-giver of the Iewes; neither doth any law bind the Gentiles, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> gave it, but becauſe only it is written on their hearts; If by ſtranger we underſtand bondſlave, or ſojourner, not yet made Proſelyte; the commandement indeed ſpeaks of him, but not to him; of him, for his eaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; not to him, for his obſervation; ſuch were not
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7847:59"/>obliged, unleſſe firſt adopted; as appears in the law of the Paſſover.</p>
               <p>If any ſay, why then did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> threaten the Merchants of <hi>Tyre</hi> for breaking the Sabbath day?</p>
               <p>I anſwere, he did it not, becauſe he thought them bound to keep the Sabbath; but becauſe<note n="a" place="margin">Ne quid oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some therefore, that were weak amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, might be entangled in that ſuperſtition: Others, that were ſtronger, might be hindred, and prejudiced in their ſafety by thoſe that were contrary minded; and all were bid to pray againſt the judgement of God, which hanged over the head of the bloody City, and whatſoever might in any degree further, and increaſe the ſame, though themſelves were not engaged therein.</p>
               <p>To the eight, the riſeing of mans corruption a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any law gives no true eſtimate of the Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof. It is generally the effect of lawes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, to beget an appetite in men to the thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; the motions of ſinne are ſet on work by the law. Beſides, if the rule given were a certaine Maxim, then on the contrary, that law, againſt which humane corruptions doe leaſt riſe (which without queſtion are the Commandements of the firſt table) ſhould be leaſt Morall; which I think no man will affirme. But to paſſe by this, I would gladly know, againſt what in the Sabbath mans corruptions be ſo rebellious? I doubt not, but you will ſay, againſt the ſtrict and holy obſervation thereof; but the manner how the law bids, is one thing; and the manner how the day is to be obſerved, is another; of which we ſhall alſo ſpeak, in due place.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:7847:60"/>
               <p>To the ninth, taken from experience in forraine parts; in the firſt place I anſwere, that the reformed Churches of God beyond the ſeas are much behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto you for branding them with laying religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the back, ſetting up Atheiſme, and Epicureiſme. And I believe many of this judgement are as free from thoſe evils, as any Sabbatharian in the world. But ſtrange it is, that ſome men cannot vent their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell fancies, unleſſe, like new wine, they break the old bottles of love.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you will ſay, men will take liberty to be prophane, when all tye of conſcience is taken off; as when the Morality of this law is denied.</p>
               <p>But we muſt know, that the conſcience is not let looſe, as is ſuppoſed; but only bound in another way, as we ſhall ſee hereafter. It hath ever been the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of all ſorts of people, thus to palliate their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours under the titles of holineſſe.</p>
               <p>To the tenth, the Homily is very briefe in this point; the <hi>Summa totalis</hi> is this. Firſt, that although God be at all times to be glorified for his mercies, yet his pleaſure is, there ſhould be ſet time for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that this Commandement given in the Decalogue doth not bind us Chriſtians, as it did the Iewes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that whatſoever is found in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement appertaining to the Law of Nature, as a thing needfull to the ſetting forth of Gods glory, ought to be received of all men.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:7847:60"/>
               <p>Laſtly, that the ſet time of Gods publique worſhip ought to be on one day of ſeven. This indeed, which is laſt, ſeemes to be ſomething; but ſeemes only, for it muſt receive conſtruction according to the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on which the Homily buildeth, <hi>viz.</hi> that nothing herein is Morall, but what appertaineth to the law of nature. Seeing therefore that this particular cannot be deduced out of the Law of nature, the Homily never intended it for Morall.</p>

                  </label> It will be ſaid, that then the Homily doth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it ſelfe; for if nothing, but what is naturall, muſt be retained, and one in ſeven be not naturall; how can the Homily affirme, that one in ſeven muſt for ever be obſerved; and that, by the will, and commandement of God himſelfe.</p>

                  </label> But for anſwere hereunto, firſt let it be conſidered, that the Homily ſpeaks by way of exhortation, <hi>&amp; ad populum;</hi> and in treatiſes of this nature every paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is not rigorouſly to be preſſed for advantage in diſputation. This favour muſt be yeelded to all the popular tractates of the ancient Fathers, elſe many things may well be quarelled at in them. Secondly, let the paſſage it ſelfe be well conſtrued, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily clears it ſelfe; for it ſaies indeed, that Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement was ſo to the Iewes; but the Chriſtians have followed this example voluntarily and of their own choice; and if of their own choice, then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe not by any neceſſity of Morall precept.</p>
               <p>To the eleventh, what if the Church retaine, and read this amongſt the Moralls? Doth ſhe not alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7847:61"/>by her Liturgy <hi>Leviticus</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> to be read amongſt other parts of Scripture? Or doe we thinke with the <hi>Maniches,</hi> that the old Teſtament is not the word of God: or with the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> that it appertaines not unto vs. We retain and read the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall law in our congregations, not ſo much for the Ceremon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es themſelves, which are vaniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; as for thoſe eternall truths, of which they were ſhadowes. And as we retain, and read them: ſo we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pray unto God for his mercy and grace, that wee may fulfill and practiſe them, ſo farre forth as they doe concerne us. There be therefore two things, which we aske in that ſhort petition following the commandement.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that our hearts may be graciouſly inclined, to ſanctify all ſuch times, as are ſet apart for Gods publique worſhip.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that as long as we live here in the vale of miſery, and ſinne, we may be enabled by his grace to keep a perpetuall ſpirituall Sabbath in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and holines, and peace of conſcience all our daies.</p>
               <p>To the twelfth, this takes deep impreſſion amongſt the vulgar, who have been taught their ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandemens perhaps for their prayers from their cradles, and therefore ſtand for this <hi>tanquam pro aris, &amp; focis.</hi> But in one word to give them ſatisfaction; the argument is denied; for there are and ever will be ten Morals, though the letter of the fourth be Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall. That God muſt have his ſet, and appointed Sabbaths, which is the eſſence, life, ſpirit of that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7847:61"/>Commandement, is for ever Morall, though the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, expreſſed in the text, be Ceremoniall. And this is no novell aſſertion, but the common do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of all antiquity. And therefore<note n="a" place="margin">S. Chryſ.

                  </note> The ſame Father diſputing in another place, how the Commandements of the Decalogue were a killing letter, as well as the Ceremonies, makes frequent diſtinction between this one of the Sabbath, and the reſt; affirming, that not only this, but thoſe nine alſo were a killing letter.

               <p>AS light, and truth multiply themſelves by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, ſo doth darkneſſe and errour. One er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour therefore admitted, many others are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, either by way of conſequence, or imitation. It was heretofore an opinion, which at this day is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in the hearts of many of our people; <hi>that an unconverted Miniſter could not convert his hearers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unregenerate himſelfe, he could not be uſed as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of an others regeneration.</hi> This poſition, <hi>the very pillar of Puritaniſme,</hi> being rejected, at leaſt in ſhew, by thoſe that wiſhed well to the cauſe; an other point of doctrine began to be broached in the roome thereof, but in effect, much the ſame, <hi>viz. that an unſanctified man cannot acquaint the people with the truth of God, at leaſt ſo well as others;</hi> that God hides himſelfe from men of corrupt mindes, revealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe only to ſome peculiar and ſelected ones. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we would at any time have our underſtandings informed in things we know not, our conſciences ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in things doubtfull, or be directed in any of our waies, either with God or men, we muſt repaire to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7847:63"/>thoſe that are of ſtricteſt lives, of preciſeſt carriages, and ſanctified converſations; for the more holy the man, the more ſound, and orthodox are all his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. Hence it hath come to paſſe, that by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to holineſſe, ſo many Oracles have been of late yeares erected in ſundry corners of this land, unto which our well minded people have repayred, as the Heathens did to the ſtoole of Apollo; the Iewes to the breaſt of the high Prieſt; &amp; the Papiſts this day to the Sea of Rome. And to ſpeak truth, this point is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Popery taken in at the back doore: for why doe the Romaniſts think the Pope to be infallible? but that they hold him to be, (as they ſtile him) <hi>His holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse;</hi> being that <hi>ſpirituall man</hi> (of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>that judgeth all things, himſelfe judged of none,</hi> as<note n="a" place="margin">Soto in <hi>4.</hi> ſent. diſt. <hi>25.</hi> art. <hi>1.</hi> concl. <hi>1.</hi>

                  <hi>Soto</hi> hath interpreted. The difference only is, the Pope challengeth unto himſelfe abſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility; theſe men only likelyhood, and probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and eminency above others.</p>
               <p>This laſt errour is worſe then the former; for that was not only odious, being raked out of the graves of ſome ancient Hereticks, but deſtitute alſo of tolerable probability. This latter is ſomewhat more refined, and perfumed, and ſeemes to be ſupported by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, reaſon, and authority.

This he confirmes by the words of our Saviour, <hi>I thank thee o Father,</hi> &amp;c. and by the example of the ſheepheards, to whom the Angels appeared &amp; preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt; when the wiſe men of the Eaſt, <hi>Herod</hi> the King, the high Prieſts and Elders knew not where to find him. Beſides, it is the nature of the word to be plaine, and facill to ſuch as are of a ſemblable diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto: but hard and difficult to thoſe, that are Rebellious. <hi>It giveth light to the ſimple</hi> ſaith<note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 19.</note> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; where there is humility of ſpirit, ſimplicity of mind, ſyncerity of heart, a conſcionable walking with God, <hi>the light of the word ſhineth even to the perfect day.</hi> For as in naturall things there muſt be a proportion between the eye and the object: ſo in things ſpirituall, he muſt have a ſtrong vigorous eye, that muſt look upon the Sunne. The eye of a child, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is tender, and weak, is dazeled as ſoon as it feeles the aire; a blear eye ſmarts at every looking up. The naturall unregenerate man hath the eyes of the <hi>Nycticorax</hi> or night crow, compared with divine
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7847:64"/>truths, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth. Laſtly, there be many impediments in the unregenerate, which ſerve as ſtrong barres to keep out the light of truth; as pride, vanity, deceit, hypocriſy, ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. A veſſell ſo full of filth and rottenneſſe cannot be capable of the <hi>ſyncere milk of the word:</hi> or if any thereof happen to enter, it receives a taint from the veſſell that receives it; the liquor ſmels of the Cask; and the ſpider converts all things into poiſon.

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe doth confeſſe, that pious and good men have not ſo many lets and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances to keep them from truth, as others have, in whom their judgements, being corrupted by their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, neither doe, nor can, by themſelves, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, underſtand the doctrine of faith preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
               <p>This being that, which is thus ſpeciouſly ſaid in the defence of this. Paradox, we will briefly diſcover the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7847:65"/>falſhood and vanity thereof for the ſatisfaction of the judicious, and indifferent reader, by diſtinguiſhing thoſe things, which are thus confuſedly heaped, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For he that hath truth to himſelfe in groſſe, may well vent to others errour by retaile. We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſtinguiſh.</p>
               <p>Firſt, of the perſons of men unregenerate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> eſtate, or being <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, of the things of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, of the knowledge of thoſe things.</p>
               <p>Vnregenerate men are of divers kinds; either ſuch as are apparently known, &amp; may be averred for ſuch, both by the judgement of faith, and the judgement of charity: as Heathens, Infidels, Apoſtates, Hereticks; Or they are ſuch as are in the boſome of the viſible Church, known unto us only in generall by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of faith, which ſaith there are ſuch, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known unto us by the judgement of charity, when we come to look upon particulars. Beſides, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate within the Pale of the Church are either private, and ordinary people; or publique perſons, guifted, and qualified to the ſervice of the Church.</p>
               <p>To be ſpirituall, is alſo of doubtfull ſignification; for as the ſpirit of God dwelleth, and worketh in men diverſly, ſo are they in different kinds ſpirituall. Now the ſpirit worketh by his graces; and theſe are either ſuch, as well call ſaving graces, as faith, hope, love, feare, obedience, given to men for their own profit, by the help whereof they work out their own
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7847:65"/>ſalvation: or ſuch, as we call common graces, as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, tongues, healings &amp;c. which God beſtows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men for the good of the Church, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the ſalvation of other men.</p>
               <p>The things of God are alſo of two ſorts; ſome are only <hi>in fide,</hi> Circumſtantiall; things in, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning faith, and religion, without the knowledge of which we may well be ſaved: Others are <hi>de fide,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall truths; ſuch, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> hath in his Creed, of which he ſaith, <hi>he that believeth them not, cannot poſsibly be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, the knowledg of holy things is two fold: <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> and <hi>experimentall:</hi> by the one, we know what the things are in themſelves; by the other, we have a lively ſenſe, and feeling of them in our own ſoules.</p>
               <p>Theſe diſtinctions being applyed to our preſent purpoſe, the truth opens it ſelf in theſe propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the unregenerate, and unſanctified without the Church, diſcern no kind of heavenly truths of what ſort ſoever; unleſſe they be alſo naturall, to be found out by diſcourſe of reaſon; or morall, written upon their hearts. Of ſuch as theſe the words of the Apoſtle are to be underſtood; <hi>The naturall man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of God;</hi> and that of our Saviour, <hi>my ſheep hear my voice.</hi> And in this condition S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf in that paſſage of his confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. There is indeed no proportion between the light of their darkned minds, and the light of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall ſaving truths.</p>

               <p>Secondly, the unregenerate within the Church, if publique perſons, if ſufficiently qualified by nature, education, and common graces, being diligent in their places, with the ordinary concurrence and aſſiſtance of the ſpirit, may as infallibly deliver the doctrine of religion, as any other, not ſuperiour unto them in the fore named indowments; eſpecially if they be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied in them with common modeſty and civility.<note n="p" place="margin">Qui expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Thirdly, the title of ſpirituall agreeth not only, or in a more proper and peculiar ſence to thoſe, that are regenerate and truly ſanctified; then it doth to thoſe, who are only inlightned; but rather on the contrary. When the Prophets claim unto themſelves the ſpirit, and to be ſpirituall, they underſtand the ſpirit of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination only.<note n="ſ" place="margin">Hoſea 9.7.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſpirituall mean is mad. And when

                  <hi>I was in the ſpirit</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that is, raviſhed in a propheticall viſion, or extaſy. So the Apoſtle cals the gift of tongues, interpretation of tongues, propheſies, <hi>ſpirituall gifts;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the regenerate, and truly ſanctified chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are not priviledged above others in thoſe things, which are only <hi>in fide,</hi> or circumſtantiall points of religion; howſoever it be otherwiſe with them in thoſe things, which are <hi>de fide,</hi> wherin the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, &amp; eſſence of ſaving faith doth conſiſt.

                  <hi>and they ſhall know the doctrine whether it be of God.</hi> Hence it oftentimes comes to paſſe, that in theſe things a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple illiterate perſon underſtandeth more then learned Clearks: they being ſometimes hid from the wiſe, as when the indignation of the Lord, upon their pride, and obſtinacy, ſpreadeth a vaile over their hearts.

                  <hi>I thank thee O Father, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe, and haſt revealed them unto Babes.</hi> Although then other points of religion are not preſently known unto men; for theſe the ſpirit reſerveth unto itſelfe, and by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meanes revealeth to one in one kind, to another in another: yet in thoſe things, which are neceſſary unto ſalvation, the regenerate, having the ſpirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them, ſhall be kept by the mighty power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

But all other authors I ſo read, as that though they excell in learning, and holineſse, yet I think nothing true, becauſe they ſo thought it; but becauſe they make it appear to be true by thoſe Canonicall Authors, or probable reaſons at the least.</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> A learned man alſo of theſe times hath ſpoken ſo home in this point, that nothing more need be added thereunto. <hi>If at any time</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Lights of the Church think not the ſame things, but diſsent one from another in divers points, and thoſe of moment in religion; what is to be done? But to try all things, and to hold that, which is good.</hi> But how may we doe this? ſhall our labour be to ſearch which Side was more docible and deſirous to learne, had more humble minds, did more tremble at Gods word, were more obſequious to the guidance of his ſpirit, were more ready to renounce themſelves, and their own wiſdomes, worſhipped God with greater fear, and reverence, were more frequent and earneſt in their daily prayers, faſted oftner to keep the body in ſubjection, were more exerciſed in the reading of the word, and meditating therein. Who ſees not this
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7847:69"/>kind of touchſtone of Eccleſiaſticall doctrine to be neither commanded of God, nor approved of men, nor to be attempted with any hope of good ſucceſſe? God forbid, that as often as we diſſent one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ſhould preſently object to the adverſe part, that they neither fear God, nor ſerve him, nor doe his will. For neither are we able to dive into mens hearts, and the better we our ſelves are, the more conſcious of our ſins, more ready to amplify our own miſdeeds, more mild and mercifull in cenſuring of others. Leaving therefore this kind of ſearch, which after many obſcure, and ſlippery <hi>Meanders</hi> gives but a doubtfull iſſue, and ſcarce ever brings us to the truth; what remaines, but to bring the dictates of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Divines to the <hi>Law,</hi> and to the <hi>Teſtimony?</hi> If they indure not this tryall, thoſe other are but popular, and gawdy ſhewes, wherewith ſimple people are deluded. Let this be the tryall. It were eaſy to anſwere the weightieſt arguments, againſt which nothing can be ſaid, with an anſwere <hi>ad hominem</hi> as they call it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom, whatſoever he be, ſome exception or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be taken.</p>
               <p>But though the perſons of the Teachers may not be weighed in this ballance, yet their doctrines may. Becauſe therefore the adverſe part doth ſo highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance theirs of the Morality of the Sabbath for pious, and religious: as if without it holineſſe it ſelfe could not ſubſiſt in the world; and ſo farre depreſſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as if it were the only floodgate to let in Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme. It will not be amiſſe briefly comparing each
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7847:69"/>with other, to ſee which doth moſt advance Gods glory, moſt edify his Church, give moſt life to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and bring moſt comfort to a Chriſtian mans conſcience. Suppoſe therefore one ſhould tell us in effect this: The fourth commandement is wholely, and meerely Morall; only indeed there be ſome Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendices thereof, which concerned the Iewes, <hi>viz.</hi> the day ſpoken of in the commandement, the ſeventh from the creation (whereas not that Seventh, but a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, which the Lord ſhould chooſe, is Naturall, and Morall) and the ſtrictneſſe of the Reſt, which was injoyned them in kindling of a fire. This indeed is in a ſort permitted Chriſtians under the Goſpell. Yet men may doe well to forbeare even this, and to dreſſe their meat over night; all the reſt of the Law binds us ſtrictly, nay more then ever it did the Iewes. We muſt therefore remember not to doe, either by our ſelves, or thoſe that belong unto us, the leaſt ſervile work from Saturday ſunſet till Sabbath-day ſun-ſet: or, as others, from Saturday midnight, till next day midnight: or, as others, from Sabbath-day ſun-riſing till Munday ſun-riſing; for a naturall day of twenty-foure houres muſt preciſely be obſerved. In all this time, all works, words, and thoughts are to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, which may at any time elſe be done, ſpoken, or had; ſo that both in publique and private we be imployed only in the holy things of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the publique exerciſe being ended; for a Sermon muſt of neceſſity be heard, neither may men ſatisfy themſelves with the common <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the Church,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7847:70"/>if they purpoſe to ſanctify to the Lord an holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. The publique exerciſe (I ſay) being ended, a ſhort <hi>meale</hi> may be made, for this is no day to feed the body in, and to make a feaſt on this day is utterly unlawfull. After dinner, ſee that you fetch not your wonted walkes, or any way recreate your ſelves, or have any communication but of holy things, and what was delivered in the Congregation. If any man, not acquainted with the myſteries of Godlineſſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you a meſſage, or letter upon that day, you may receive it of civility; but ſee you neither diſpatch the buſineſſe, nor think thereon untill next morning, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paine of ſinne. Be ſure alſo to take your notes, and repeat to all ſuch, as ſhall aſſemble themſelves, what you have writen, and ſo repaire unto the evening Sermon, which alſo muſt be heard either at home, or abroad. This done, give not your ſelves a breathing while; ſuffer neither Child, nor Servant to have any recreation; for this were to prophane the day. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble therefore your ſelves together, recount what the Afternoon hath brought forth; doe alſo likewiſe after ſupper. Nor yet are you by all this diſcharged of the duties of the holy Sabbath, unleſſe the former practices have made ſuch deep impreſſion in your phanſies, as to ſeaſon the nights ſleep with holy dreames, which is the laſt duty of the Sabbath. Theſe things thus done, you may not only well expect a bleſſing upon what you have heard, but upon all that is yours the whole week after. For ſo highly is the ſeventh day in Gods favour, that he doth not only
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7847:70"/>ſanctify it, but alſo bleſſe it.</p>
               <p>Now let another come, and ſay, the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of the Decalogue be not all of the ſame rank, but amongſt theſe the fourth is partly Morall, partly Ceremoniall. The Morall part is, that God muſt have ſet, and ſtanding times for his outward, and ſolemne worſhip; all which times are religiouſly to be obſerved. But the letter concernes only the Iewes, written indeed, as other holy things of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for our edification, and conſolation, of which every part if full. For firſt, we muſt conſider, that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, as it is there litterally expreſſed, was a ſigne of the ſeparation of the Iewes to be Gods people from all other nations of the world; which is now by the coming of Chriſt aboliſhed, as all other peices of the wall of partition are taken down, that the Gentiles may glorify God, as it is written<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 32.43.</note> 
                  <hi>Reioyce ye Gentiles with his people.</hi> It did alſo ſhew them the proneneſſe of our corrupt nature to doe our own wills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to fulfill our own luſts, not ſuffering the Lord to rule in us by his Spirit; whereas he requires perfect confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the whole man, with an utter ceſſation from all his ſervile works of ſinne, and Satan. It did in the third place lead them unto Chriſt, who alone gives us teſt from theſe cruell Taskmaſters; who hath crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the body of ſinne in us, and triumphed over Satan in his croſſe. And therefore as God the Father, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the World in ſixe daies, reſted the ſeventh: ſo God the Sonne finiſhed all things, which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him for our redemption on the ſixt day, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7847:71"/>began his reſt on the ſeventh, obtaining for us the reſt both of grace, and glory. The reſt therefore of the Sabbath given in ſuch ſevere precepts unto the Iewes doth lead us Chriſtians under the Goſpell unto the reſt of ſanctification, which we muſt endeavour to keep inviolable with all watchfulneſse, not ſuffering the leaſt fire to be kindled in any of our luſts. And as it doth thus edify: ſo it miniſtreth no ſmall comfort, aſsuring us, that as God reſted from all his works, and Chriſt from his: ſo we alſo by degrees ſhall enter into reſt in the Church militant, till it be perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated in the Church Triumphant; as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 4.9.</note> 
                  <hi>there remaineth a rest for Gods people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let the indifferent Reader judge, whether the former of theſe doe not burthen, and indeed enſnare the conſciences of men with many outward, unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, impoſſible performances, even to ſuperſtition, and without end; whereas this latter doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the very pith, and marrow of Religion; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the care, and ſtudy of true ſanctification, and is moſt quickening, and cordiall to weak, and tender conſciences. But not to ſtray in this by-path any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it were much to be wiſhed as one of the greateſt bleſſings of God upon his Church, that<note n="a" place="margin">Sacra Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legia pium, &amp; prudentem Lectorem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirit.

                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith well, all things are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be miſtaken, if they retaine not their true, and proper names. Being therefore to treat of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an festivall,</hi> and the Queſtions moved concerning the ſame; the firſt thing, which offers it ſelfe, is, whether it muſt, or fitly may be ſtiled the <hi>Sabbath day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The affirmative tenent is ſupported by theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, thoſe names, which God himſelfe hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, are without all queſtion moſt proper, and moſt fit to be retained: But God himſelfe hath impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Name <hi>Sabbath</hi> upon all daies of his ſolemne

For not only the ſeventh day in the fourth Commandement, but all the new Moones, and other feſtivals of the Iewes, are commonly called <hi>Sabbaths:</hi> Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly thoſe names are commonly beſt, which are moſt ancient. <hi>Inquire</hi> (ſaith<note n="b" place="margin">Iob. <hi>8.8.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly that name is alwaies beſt, which doth moſt acquaint us with the nature of the thing. In this the excellent Wiſdome, which God gave unto <hi>Adam,</hi> appeared, that he gave names to all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures anſwerable to their natures: But the name <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> given to the daies of publique worſhip, is ſuch: for they are daies of reſt unto us, and they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in remembrance of Gods reſt at the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of Chriſts reſt in the Reſurrection, and are pledges of our future reſt in glory. What name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can better agree unto them then <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which is as much as <hi>Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, that name is doubtleſse beſt, which beſt directs us to the duties of the day: For if<note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>FOr the Negative opinion ſtand theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſpeaks beſt of things, whoſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is moſt conformable to the holy Ghoſt in the Scripture: But the holy Ghoſt doth every where in the new Teſtament (which alone ſpeaks of the Chriſtian mans <hi>Holy-day,</hi> as having being, and exiſtency) call it the <hi>Lords day,</hi> no where the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day; The name of the <hi>Lords day</hi> is therefore beſt, and fitteſt to be uſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſhould retaine thoſe names, which the Primitive Church in the pureſt times the firſt three hundered yeares chiefly uſed, unleſſe through any
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7847:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>corruption, or abuſe they are ſcandalous: But the name of the <hi>Lords day</hi> hath been chiefly uſed in the Primitive Church, and in the pureſt times; neither is it ſince through any abuſe become ſcandalous; <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, we of the reformed Churches ſhould not forſake the Roman Church, but where neceſſity doth inforce us; For then we are guilty of that Schiſme, which is made in the Chriſtian world; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould we vary from our ſelves ſo much, as (were it poſſible) in ſounds, and Syllables; for then we may be juſtly noted for ſingularity and affectation: But both the Romane Church, and all reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches uſe to ſtile it the <hi>Lords day,</hi> not the <hi>Sabbath, Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, we that are Chriſtians ſhould beware how we gratify the Iewes in their ſuperſtitious obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy againſt Chriſt, and his Goſpell in the leaſt things; leaſt we partake with them in their hardneſſe of heart; the ancient Chriſtians faſted Saturday, eſpecially for this reaſon, becauſe the Iewes faſted on Satt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rday. But in uſing the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> we gratify the Iewes in their obſtinacy againſt Chriſt, and his Goſpell. For they abhorre the name of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as the greateſt Blaſphemy: Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it is one of the chiefeſt points of a Chriſtian mans wiſdome ſo to ſpeak, as not to put a ſtumbling block before his weaker Brethren: He that doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 14.15.</note> 
                  <hi>walketh not charitably,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: But the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> may be, and is become a ſnare
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7847:74"/>to many weak ones, eſpecially in reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For where ever they find the name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> they preſently conceive it to be ſpoken of, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the <hi>Lords day;</hi> and many times by this means fall into flat <hi>Iudaiſme:</hi> as appears by their quoting of the old Teſtament in the Queſtions in hand: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that name, which doth leſſe edify, is leſſe proper. This, I thinke, will eaſily be agreed on by all parties: But the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> doth leſſe edify. For it leads us only to an outward ceſſation from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily labour; which of it ſelfe, and preciſely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red was indeed a duty of the Iewiſh <hi>Sabbath;</hi> but is not ſo of the Chriſtian <hi>Feſtivall;</hi> as hereafter ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. On the contrary, the name <hi>Lords day</hi> doth beſt open and explain the whole nature, and duty of the day; as the remembrance of Chriſts reſurrection, the acknowledgment of his Lordſhip over the Church, and all other Creatures in the world: <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi>

I deny not, but the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and may alſo be uſed by ſuch, as have their wits well exerciſed in Scriptures, if without ſuperſtition, fraud, or ſcandall: But yet notwithſtanding the name <hi>Lords day</hi> is both more fit in it ſelfe, ſerving more for edification; and the Arguments to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary doe not conclude.</p>
               <p>To the firſt, true it is indeed, that God himſelfe in Scripture impoſeth the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> upon all daies of publique worſhip in the Iewiſh Synagogue; and the reaſon was, becauſe the very corporall reſt was a chiefe thing aimed at in them; being both <hi>memorative</hi> of ſome things paſſed, and <hi>figurative</hi> of things alſo to come: But that therefore the daies alſo of Chriſtian Aſſemblies ſhould be ſo called, doth not follow: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the reaſon is not the ſame, as ſhall appear in it's proper place. The name <hi>Sabbath</hi> therefore is no more Morall, and to be retained in the times of the Goſpell, then the name <hi>Prieſt, Altar, Sacrifice;</hi> which perhaps our adverſaries themſelves will allow of in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,

               <p>To the ſecond; No man will deny, but that anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is a good guide in the ſearch of the truth: for all errors are upſtarts, even thoſe that are gray-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The<note n="f" place="margin">Ier. 6.16.</note> Prophet therefore adviſeth <hi>to ask for the the old way,</hi> which is the good way; but his meaning is, that which is <hi>ſimply</hi> old, not <hi>comparatively</hi> only.

               <p>To the third: The name <hi>Sabbath</hi> doth not beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with the Nature of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. For the nature thereof conſiſteth not, either in our corporall, or Spirituall Reſt, or in Remembring the Reſt of God in the Creation, or in being a pledge unto us of our eternall reſt: All theſe are accidentall conſiderations of the Lords day. Indeed the memory of Chriſts reſurrection is eſſentiall thereunto; but not ſo much in regard of his reſt, as of his conqueſt over death, and the grave, and being made the Lord of the Quick, and the Dead. It being therefore the Lordſhip of Chriſt, made evident to all creatures both in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in earth, by the Glory of his Reſurrection, which is then celebrated, it ought to be ſtiled the Lords day, not a Sabbath.</p>
               <p>To the fourth: What the duties of the day be, we ſhall ſee hereafter. Let it be granted therefore for the preſent, whatſoever the Argument doth ſuggeſt, the conſequent is denied. For whatſoever duties are then performed, are, or at the leaſt ought to be directed in a ſpeciall manner unto the Lord Chriſt, as our ſervice of him. The day therefore, is to be named, not from the nature of the things done; but from the quality of the perſon, to whom they are intended; and therefore not <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but <hi>Lords day.</hi> And whereas it is ſaid, that the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> may ſerve to confirme our faith
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7847:76"/>and hope of our eternall Reſt; I anſwere, that indeed it may be ſo uſed by us, but was never ſo intended in the firſt inſtitution thereof: and being a conſideration ſo remote, it cannot claime to denominate.</p>
               <p>To the fifth: It is indeed moſt rue. that we ought not, eſpecially in matters of Religion, to innovate though but words, and Phraſes, although perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, and improper; much leſſe ought we to ſwarve from ſuch language, as is moſt ſavory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; but which name hath moſt ſalt, the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or <hi>Lords day,</hi> I hope it doth appear by this, which hath been ſaid.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7847:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>labour beſtowed upon the parts, and peices of the day, is not regarded. It is alſo that, which concernes the moſt ſort of our inferiour people to be ſatisfied in, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt the Commandement requiring one thing, their employments another, they many times wound their Conſciences, and rob themſelves of that peace, which otherwiſe they might enjoy. We muſt therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceed any farther, inquire, whether the Lords day be to conſiſt of any certain determinate number of houres, as being a Naturall day, or Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And here our Adverſaries are very poſitive, that the Chriſtian mans Sabbath, as well as that of the Iewes, is to conſiſt of full twenty foure houres; and they have theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, all the time, that the Commandement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, is to be obſerved. But that the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Sabbath requires a whole naturall day from evening to evening is undenyable: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore &amp;c. If any man ſay the Commandement was Ceremoniall, and ſo proves nothing for the Chriſtian obſervation; it may be replied, that this being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all the other branches; yet it is not ſo in this. For no man can ſhew, how the time of twenty foure houres can be in any reſpect myſticall. Though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt of the latter ſhould vaniſh as a ſhadow, yet in this particular it muſt needs continue Morall.</p>
               <p>Secondly no one day of the week is longer or ſhorter then other: but if the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as the reſt, hath not twenty foure houres, it muſt needs be ſhorter, &amp; that, which is next there unto, either going before, or come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7847:77"/>after muſt be longer then any other day. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is a good Rule, which the Rabbins give; that we ſhould not take from that which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to adde to that which is prophane, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: But if the day of Gods publique worſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us have not allowed it ſo many houres, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daies, we take from that which is holy, and adde to that which is prophane, even our own ſecular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; which were impious, and ſacrilegious: Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly if the Iewes Sabbath were to conſiſt of twenty foure houres, then much more the Chriſtians. For we have both received more, and greater bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and we alſo have more and greater myſteries of Godlineſſe to contemplate; But the Iewiſh Sabbath was a whole naturall day: Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the Scripture ſeemes to be plaine to this purpoſe. For the 92. Pſalme was the Pſalme of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> as appears by the title thereof, and in the very begining thereof the Prophet ſets downe the very time of its obſervation, ſaying,<note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 92.1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>it is a good thing to praiſe the Lord, and to ſing unto thy name O most High; to declare thy loving kindneſſe in the morning, and thy truth in the night ſeaſon,</hi> meaning a whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall day: Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, we muſt reſt, as God Reſted, begining to reſt from the works of our callings, when God began to reſt from the worke of Creation. For Gods reſt is propounded in the Commandement to be our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7847:77"/>but God began his reſt at evening the ſixt day, immediatly after the making of the woman; and ſo continued the day of his reſt which was the ſeventh. If therefore our Reſt muſt be anſwerable to Gods Reſt, it muſt begin at evening, and continue till eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, as Chriſt reſted, ſo muſt the Chriſtian reſt; his actions were our inſtructions; and we call the day of our Reſt <hi>the Lords,</hi> becauſe it was dedicated unto him; but Chriſt finiſhed his courſe, and began his Reſt over night, reſting in the grave foure and twenty houres at the leaſt: Our Reſt therefore, being grounded upon Chriſts Reſt, cannot be leſſe then a whole Naturall day.</p>
               <p>Eightly, as the Apoſtles, to whom the obſervation of the day was immediatly preſcribed by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, kept the day in their own perſons: ſo doubtleſſe muſt we their ſucceſſors in all after ages: But the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles <hi>Sabbath</hi> was a whole naturall day. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> practice at <hi>Troas,</hi> when he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and adminiſtred the Sacrament, and communed with the Diſciples of holy things (all duties of the Lords day)<note n="k" place="margin">Acts 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.11.</note> 
                  <hi>untill the morning:</hi> Ergo &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, as our Saviour, who inſtituted the day, obſerved it in his own perſon: ſo doubtleſſe muſt the Church for ever. But our Saviour appeared (and his very apparition was the inſtitution) not only early in the morning, but alſo<note n="l" place="margin">Iohn 20.19.</note> 
                  <hi>late at night</hi> to his Diſciples; and even then preached unto them, and gave them the holy Ghoſt, with the keyes of the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7847:78"/>therefore &amp;c. If any object, that by <hi>night</hi> in that place is underſtood the evening or ſhutting in of the light only, making it thereby a day artificiall; the very circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances of the Text are againſt him. For <hi>first the doores of the houſe were ſhut</hi> (ſaith the Text) which is not uſually done in the evening; <hi>Secondly,</hi> they feared a ſearch would be made for them, which is commonly done in the dead, and depth of the night; Thirdly<note n="m" place="margin">Profundâ jam nocte.

                  <hi>Aretius</hi> a good Proteſtant Expoſitor ſaith expreſly, it was very late in the night.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, as the Primitive Church obſerved the day, ſo muſt we: But the Primitive Church kept a night, as well as a day; as plainly appears by their <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gills</hi> and <hi>over-night aſſemblies,</hi> not only in time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, but when the <hi>Emperours</hi> themſelves were <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Every man knowes, and we read unto this day the Sermons of the ancient Fathers in their <hi>vigils,</hi> which doubtleſſe had never been, but that they held themſelves obliged to a twenty-foure-houres <hi>Sabbath</hi> at the leaſt: Therefore &amp;c.</p>

                  </label> This no way agreeth with the intention of the Lawgiver, which in commanding the Sabbath had a twofold intention: the one his own publique worſhip, and the ſpirituall good of mankind; the other the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall refreſhing, and reviving the bodies of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and of all that belonges unto them. I would now gladly know what refreſhing the body of a man hath by the Sabbath, if he muſt labour about holy things not only all day, but moſt part of the night al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. But I think no ſober minded man will ſay, it is a ſinne to goe to bed ſooner upon this night, then upon others; or if any doe, few I preſume will believe him therein.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the Chriſtian Holyday were to conſiſt of a certaine determinate number of houres; either the new Teſtament, which alone ſpeaks of this day: or the Church of Chriſt, who alone obſerves it, would have directed us, where to begin thoſe houres, and where to end them. For the Iewes were expreſly ſo directed: but neither the new Teſtament, nor the Church of Chriſt hath given any ſuch directions.</p>
               <p>If any ſay, we need no ſuch new information in this point, having already the ſame, which the Iewes had in the fourth Commandement; we ſhall I hope give him ſatisfaction in the anſwere to the firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the precedent chapter, which it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if a Lords night be to be ſanctifyed, as well as the day, this night, and all the parts thereof muſt differ from other nights, by ſome ſpeciall appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7847:79"/>to the Lord, as the day differs from other daies; But how can this be, unleſſe we reſt not at all that night in our beds, or ſerve God by dreames and viſions? Which to affirme were notoriouſly abſurd.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, there is no morall law in nature, nor poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive law in Scripture, but is in it ſelfe poſſible to all men in all parts of the world in regard of the thing commanded. But a naturall day-Sabbath, as it is made to conſiſt of a day and a night, is abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for ſome men in ſome parts of the world, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the thing commanded: in ſome parts there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but day, and in other places nothing but night for a long ſpace together. This is ſo apparent as needs no proofe: Therefore &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7847:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>they had with other nations, which proved their ruin; but for any voyages they made, or Colonies they deduced, we read none. <hi>Solomon,</hi> it is true, ſent a navy unto <hi>Ophyr,</hi> which is <hi>Peru,</hi> as moſt conceive; or as <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> ſome place in the Eaſt Indies: <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the like, but his ſhips were broken at <hi>Ezion, Geber.</hi>

It's uſuall in this language to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſignifications: But let it be granted, that they meet with ſome Hebrew words in that tongue; what nation is there, in whoſe language you may not make the like obſervation. Say alſo that the Iewes travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the Eaſt, and weſt Indies for Gold and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I think it eaſy to ſhew, that thoſe parts of the world, in which are either continuall day or night, were not known untill after Chriſt, and the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hieruſalem. In a word, had the Iewes at any time travailed into ſuch places, where they could not have kept their Sabbath from evening to evening, it had been ſinne unto them; For when a man ſhall, by any voluntary action of his own, caſt himſelfe into an utter impoſſibility of fulfilling any poſitive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the law of God, it becomes evill unto him,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7847:80"/>though otherwiſe it be both lawfull, and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The caſe therefore is not the ſame with the Iewes, and us in this point, they being preciſely bound both to places, and houſes, from both which Chriſt hath ſet us free. The objection is of no weight.</p>
               <p>Fiftly to make the night part of the Lords day to be obſerved by the Church of Chriſt, is contrary to the ground of the inſtitution thereof, which is the Reſurrection of Chriſt. For Chriſt roſe not in the night, but early in the morning, and being riſen, his Reſurrection hath no night. But how can the night remember us of that, which hath no night? If we keep the night before, we ſolemnize not Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, for he was not as yet riſen; if the night af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we ſeeme to be enemies of his reſurrection, as if the Sunne of righteouſneſſe were ſet the ſecond time, whereas<note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 6 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt being riſen, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any man ſay, he keepeth not the night, as a part of the Lords day, the memoriall of Chriſt Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but as a part of his Sabbath in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; He ſeemeth expreſly to forſake Chriſt, and to cleave to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and being weary of being a Chriſtian, defires to turne Iew.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, A night Sabbath is contrary to the end of the Inſtitution under the Goſpell, which was Gods publique worſhip in the congregation, for other uſe thereof we find not in holy Scripture. If any man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, collections to be made for the poore, private prayers, and chriſtian exerciſes &amp;c. we ſhall, God
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7847:81"/>willing, ſpeak thereof alſo in its place. But night aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies for the publique worſhip (except in time of perſecution) are contrary to the Apoſtles Rule,<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 14.40.</note>

For if the naturall day be meaſured by the revolution of the Sunne, as all confeſſe, ſure it is, that untill the Sunne begin his courſe, the day can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not begin. At what time now did the Sunne ſet forth upon the fourth day at the creation? Common reaſon will ſay, when he firſt appeared in the Horizon; the riſing therefore of the Sunne in the Horizon muſt needs be the firſt period of the naturall day.

                  </note> was the firſt day. The words alſo of S. <hi>Mathew</hi> before cited make it apparent; in which not only midnight, but to the very dawning belonged not to the firſt, but laſt day of the week. It was not of it, but towards it: as the end of one contiguum is the begining of another. By all which it is apparent, that when God commanded the Iewes their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths from evening to evening, the order of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall day was inverted by him, not ſo much looking to the number of foure and twenty houres, as to the time of Iſraels deliverance out of Egypt, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, when the Paſſover was eaten at even; of which their deliverance the Sabbath is a memoriall, as hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p>Some thing alſo muſt be ſaid of the <hi>day Artificiall</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:7847:82"/>which we may define to be a certain proportion of houres, appointed by men, and employed by Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers about their crafts, and trades. This is not the whole time between Sunne, and Sunne, but generally (I think) conceived by all nations to be meaſured by twelve houres, according to that of our Saviour:<note n="*" place="margin">Iohn 11.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Are there not twelve houres of the day?</hi> And, as the<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 27.</note> Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt deſcribes the paſſion of Chriſt by the <hi>third, ſixt,</hi> and <hi>ninth houres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus briefly ſet down the <hi>day Naturall,</hi> and <hi>Artificiall;</hi> whereas it is generally ſuppoſed by all men almoſt, that the <hi>Lords day</hi> muſt be meaſured by one of theſe two proportions of houres; the truth is, there is no ſuch portion of time ſet us in the New Teſtament, which alone can direct us in the Lords day; neither expreſly, nor implicitly. Vnleſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will have recourſe unto the Iewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and begin the obſervation thereof over night, and that Analogically, becauſe Chriſt himſelfe our Paſſover was ſacrificed at Evening, and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from the ſpirituall Egypt ſet on foot; the Conſcience hath no ground to ſettle upon. But what warrant Chriſtians have to follow the Iewes, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Lords day, in regard of any circumſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, I ſee not. And that Analogicall reſpect (before ſpoken of) between the ſacrificing of ours, and their Paſſover, cannot bind the conſcience. The whole therefore is left to the Church, and Magiſtrates under the Goſpell; the time being ſuch by their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as may be convenient for the publique worſhip
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7847:83"/>of God: neither doe the Arguments to the contrary conclude.</p>
               <p>To the firſt: the Iewes indeed were preſcribed a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall day,</hi> not properly, but equivocally ſo called, conſiſting of twenty foure houres; but that the time, which limited them, doth alſo limit us, is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true. And whereas it is ſaid, that the twenty-foure hovres were no way Myſticall, or Ceremoniall; It will be replyed, that though the number of houres ſpoken of (which are not ſo much as mentioned in Scripture) was in no reſpect myſticall; yet the time named from evening to evening was partly <hi>memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> looking to the time of their deliverance out of Egypt: partly <hi>poſitive,</hi> looking to the publique wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the morning and the evening ſacrifice, which concernes not us, but only in a proportion. For as the Iewes worſhipped the Lord upon the day of their Sabbath, and had ſet times of aſſembling themſelves on that day both morning and evening: ſo it is fit, and convenient, that the Chriſtians alſo worſhip the Lord in their publique aſſemblies, both in the begining, and towards the evening of their <hi>Lords day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the ſecond: A day may have a twofold conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; the one <hi>Abſolute,</hi> as it is a day; the other <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> as appointed for any uſe, or ſervice. The fifth of November may be conſidered either as ſuch a day of ſuch a moneth; and ſo it's neither longer, or ſhorter then any other naturall day: or as a day ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by the Church for publique thankſgiving, and ſo it conſiſts only of a morning, as appears by the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7847:83"/>Statute, from whence it hath authority. The caſe is the ſame in the Lords day, which continueth no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then the duties of the day require.</p>
               <p>To the third: the ſaying of the Rabbines is a good admonition to all men, not to abbreviat or leſſen the time appointed by the Church for holy duties; but this makes no more for twenty foure houres, then it doth for forty or fifty, or any other. It is (all men will confeſſe) ſacriledge to rob God of his time; but it muſt be made to appear, that God hath claimed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe this time in queſtion; till when nothing can be concluded.</p>
               <p>The fourth indeed were unanſwerable, if the caſe were, as is pretended between us, and the Iewes; But</p>
               <p>Firſt the ground, upon which this argument is builded, is ſandy; for it ſuppoſeth, that God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them from Evening to Evening to contemplate the myſteries of Godlineſſe, and mercies vouchſafed unto them; whereas it was both memorative, and myſticall, as hath been proved; neither did they ſpend the night of their Sabbath in contemplation, but in bodily Reſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is utterly untrue, that we under the Goſpell have more work for the Lords day, then the Iewes had for their Sabbath: For as<note n="e" place="margin">Lib. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Euſebius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, their religion was the ſame with Chriſtian Religion, which at this day we profeſſe;<note n="f" place="margin">1. Cor. 10.2.</note> 
                  <hi>For they all were baptized unto Moſes, and did all eat of the ſame ſpirituall meat, and drink of the ſame ſpirituall Rock, which was Christ:</hi> his meaning is, that the body and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7847:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſubſtance was the ſame, only it was cloathed with many ſhadowes, and as the Apoſtle cals them<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 4.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Beggarly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments;</hi> ſo that their Sabbath daies work was in this reſpect, as much as our Lords can be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſay, it was much greater; for how cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſome was Gods worſhip to them by Sacrificings, Purifyings, Waſhings? How did God ſeem to hide himſelfe, and his mercies from them in Types and figures, whereas he reveales himſelfe to us even in the face of Ieſus Chriſt.<note n="*" place="margin">2. Cor. 3.</note> And not only <hi>Moſes had a vaile put upon him,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">3.15.</note> but alſo <hi>their hearts, which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto this day;</hi> There was alſo a reſtraint of Gods ſpirit unto them: as of the raine in the daies of <hi>Elias;</hi> whereas now the fountaine is opened, and the ſpirit powred out. All men know, that when any thing is enquired after, it is ſooner found when it lies open, then when it is hid; by a man of underſtanding, then by a child; one that hath eyes to ſee, then by one that is hoodwinked; by one that hath many helpes, then by one that hath none; So is it between the Iewes, and us in holy things: This argument therefore is a meere <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, neither can any more prevaricating reaſon be produced.</p>
               <p>To the fift, it were to be wiſhed, that Scripture might be handled, if not with more reverence, yet with greater gentleneſſe, not thus to be racked. The 92. Pſalme was the Pſalme of the Sabbath, and it makes mention of night and day to be ſpent in the Lords prayſes; But what then, will any reaſonable man imagine, that they then had night meetings in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7847:84"/>the Temple, or ſate up late in their families that night? Thoſe times of <hi>morning</hi> and <hi>evening,</hi> if we reſtraine them, as ſpoken of the Sabbath day, are <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymically</hi> to be underſtood, for the whole worſhip of God, whenſoever performed upon that day; and are as much, as when we ſay, Morning-prayer, and Evening-prayer. But farther, notwithſtanding the Pſalme was the <hi>Sabbath-Pſalme;</hi> yet whatſoever is therein contained may not reſpectively be ſpoken of the Sabbath only.

                  <hi>Calvins</hi> obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the very words alleadged; affirming, that day and night are there put in indefinitely for all times whatſoever; as appears (ſaith he) by that, which followes: <hi>For his loving kindneſse, and his truth are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies towards us.</hi> But as thoſe, that have yellow eyes, think every thing to be of that colour: ſo theſe men cannot meet with the Lord to be praiſed night and day, eſpecially in the <hi>Sabbath-Pſalme;</hi> but it muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conclude a foure and twenty houres-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
               <p>To the ſixt; as Gods reſt began, ſo muſt ours; is a propoſition Atheologicall; For the Iewes themſelves, who obſerved the Sabbath in imitation of Gods Reſt, looked not at their patterne in this particular, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their deliverance out of Egypt; into which deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance they entred, when they ſacrificed the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The example of God is not propoſed without limitation in the Commandement; he ſo reſted, as that he never ſince returned to his labours, from which he reſted; he ſo reſted, as that he bleſſed it; in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7847:85"/>neither of which ought we to preſume to imitate his Reſt. Laſtly, I wonder how the example of Gods reſt, propoſed in the Commandement, can concerne our Lords day, which was not the day of the Lords Reſt, but the begining of his labours.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh is not much unlike.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore we obſerve not the Lords day in memory of Chriſts reſting in the grave. For though in ſome reſpects he may then be ſaid to have entred into Reſt; yet was the grave part of his humiliation alſo, and our Redemption, and no compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Reſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let it be ſuppoſed, that the grave to Chriſt was only a place of Reſt, and that he entred thereinto over-night; what is this to a twenty foure houres-Sabbath? unleſſe perhaps Chriſt reſted but juſt ſo many houres in the Grave; but how then was he three daies and three nights in the Bowels of the earth? This therefore is a meere pretence, no proof.</p>
               <p>The eight, drawn from Apoſtolicall practice, is in all parts thereof unſound. Plaine it is, that Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall practice binds not the conſcience, but where there is a precept annexed: Nay where there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept annexed, both precept and practice may be (as they ſay) <hi>ambulatorium in lege,</hi> of no laſting continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But in this point we have neither precept, nor practice, either for the preſent, or for after ages. I preſume, that no man, well conſidering the place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, can deny, what<note n="k" place="margin">Curavit ſcriptor libri cauſam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducendi ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monem produ cere. Aug. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. <hi>86.</hi> ad Cuſ.</note> S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> long ſince obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> at that time took the advantage of the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7847:85"/>preſent occaſion, and neceſſity, and not otherwiſe. Sure I am, that if the Apoſtles practice, there recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, were a preſident for us to follow; neither the whole Church of God can be excuſed, who never ſince hath obſerved ſuch a Sabbath: nor the Apoſtle himſelfe can be acquitted, who, for ought we read, never did the like before, or after in any part of the world. Beſides all this<note n="l" place="margin">Calv. in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> thinks, that the day there ſpoken of was the Iewes Sabbath, not the Lords day; reading, in ſtead of <hi>uno Sabbathorum, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Sabbatho;</hi> upon a certain Sabbath day, not Lords day. But if any liſt to be contentions herein, ſure wee are out of the Text, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> and the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on met not, till they came together to break bread, which in thoſe times was commonly after ſupper, and ſo it<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 20.7.</note> 
                  <hi>came to paſſe, that he continued his preaching till after midnight.</hi> This therefore can be no preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for a naturall daies-Sabbath, but may be allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for a night-Sabbath only; and ſuch Sabbaths were never yet heard of.</p>
               <p>To the ninth: the practice of our Saviour is (I confeſſe) of great force, and the argument drawn from thence of more probability, though it conclude not; For</p>
               <p>Firſt, the ground thereof is but looſe, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours apparition was the Inſtitution of the Lords day. For if ever our Saviour inſtituted the day, it muſt be by his Reſurrection, which is a thing diſtinct from his Apparition. Our Saviour inſtituted the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this day by his Reſurrection: as God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7847:86"/>inſtituted the Iewiſh Sabbath day by his ceaſing to work; which was only the ground, and Reaſon of the Inſtitution, as hath already been ſaid.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if the appearing of Chriſt after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection were the inſtitution of the day; it muſt needs follow, that to whom he firſt appeared, to them the day was firſt inſtituted, and commanded: now theſe muſt needs be the Souldiers, or <hi>Mary Magdalene;</hi> and if ſo, what inconveniencies follow? For by this means a publique, and everlaſting ordinance for the whole Church of Chriſt muſt be delivered either to thoſe, that are not of the Church, as the Souldiers: or to a woman, whom nature it ſelfe inhibits to teach in the Church. And whereas it is commonly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that Chriſt kept the firſt Lords-day with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, leaving an example to us therein. I cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently wonder at the boldneſſe and raſhneſſe of this Aſſertion: For let the Text be looked into, and we find therein theſe particulars. Firſt, he having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Mary</hi> early in the morning, he appears to the whole College of the Diſciples (<hi>Thomas</hi> only excepted) late at night. Then having given them his ordinary benediction, <hi>Peace be unto you,</hi> he ſhewes them his hands, and his feet. Laſtly he imparts unto them their Apoſtolicall miſſion, and indowes them with power, the keyes of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But what are all theſe to the obſervation of a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or Paſtorall charge? What Preaching, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing? What Sacraments adminiſtred? Vnleſſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhall be thought a Sacrament. It's a ſtrange keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7847:86"/>of a Sabbath, and ſuch as our adverſaries will not avow, to begin early in the morning with one, or two, and let all the reſt of the day ſlip, doeing nothing amongſt their people till late at night; and then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Preach, Pray, nor adminiſter the Sacrament. But what then was the reaſon, why our Saviour appeared ſo late in the night, and the Apoſtles in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ſate up ſo late expecting his coming? The Text doth ſatisfy both ſcruples; firſt on the Diſciples parts, that were aſſembled together, not thinking of Chriſt, but for fear of the Iewes; then on our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours part, this ſeeming unto his wiſdome the fitteſt opportunity to ſhew himſelfe unto them, to comfort them in their preſent feare; and to furniſh them with the holy Ghoſt, againſt future temptations; to which tend both his wordes, and geſtures.

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> The Queſtion concerning the inſtitution of the Lords day propoſed, with arguments for the divine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it.</head>
               <p>HAving thus entreated of the Lords day, as it is a portion of our time, to be ſet apart for holy uſes; we muſt now conſider it in regard of the inſtitution, and obſervation thereof; and firſt, whether
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7847:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>it be enjoyned by the Church by Divine, or Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall authority. To prove a divine inſtitution, either immediatly from Chriſt: or mediatly from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, are brought ſuch, and ſo many arguments, as are able, in the opinion of their owners, to convince any mans judgement, not corrupted with prophaneſſe of heart, or darkned with pride, and prejudice. We muſt therefore faithfully muſter them up in their full ſtrength, that all men of ſober mindes may take their dimenſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> it is ſaid, that God by his precept requires one of ſeven to be for ever obſerved; his words are,<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 20.10.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſeventh is the Sabbath;</hi> but the Lords day is one of the ſeven, and no other of the ſeven is to be kept Sabbath; therefore this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> all holy reſting daies are in the fourth commandement, as every <hi>ſpecies</hi> is contained in the <hi>genus,</hi> and every <hi>Individuum</hi> in the <hi>ſpecies.</hi> It muſt needs be in this, as in all other things. For example, <hi>Honour the King</hi> is a generall precept, under which the honour of all particular Kings is comprehended: honour King <hi>Richard,</hi> King <hi>Henry,</hi> King <hi>Charles:</hi> But the Lords day is an holy reſting-day, as appears by the practice of the whole Church, and was never yet denied by any enemy thereof, unleſſe he were ſome malicious perſon.

Now whatſoever is commanded the Church in the Scripture under any literall Sence, is of divine inſtitution: But the Lords day is commanded in the fourth precept, though not in the firſt, yet in the ſecond literall ſence, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that which was foretold and typified in the old Teſtament, is of divine inſtitution in the new; for where the ceremony is commanded the Iew, the ſubſtance is commanded the Chriſtian; for example: where unleavened bread is commanded them, there ſincerity, and truth is commanded us: But the Lords day was thus typified, and foretold in the Teſtament. This the Rabbins themſelues have obſerved in ſundry paſſages; <hi>Firſt,</hi> in the words of God, ſaying <hi>let there be light,</hi> therefore the Meſſiah ſhould riſe the firſt day of the week. <hi>Secondly,</hi> from the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> on the ſixt day, therefore the Meſſiah ſhould ſuffer that day, reſt in the grave the ſeventh, and riſe the next. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly,</hi> that day, which the Lord ever doth, and will bleſſe unto his Church, and people, which religiouſly obſerve it, is doubtleſſe a day of his own ordaining, and appointing; therefore <hi>ſanctified,</hi> and <hi>bleſsed</hi> are put together in the Commandement. But God hath, and continually doth, and ever will bleſſe this day with groth of grace, and all ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt to all ſuch as Religiouſly obſerve it.

                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> that which the example of God the Creator, reſting from all his works, was to the Iewes in regard of their Sabbath; that alſo the example of God the Redeemer is, and muſt be to us, that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in regard of ours: But the example of God the Father reſting from his works was a ſufficient inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iewes Sabbath; for therefore they reſted, becauſe God reſted; it ſhould therefore be a ſufficient Inſtitution unto us under the Goſpell, to reſt on the Lords day, becauſe in it Chriſt reſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly,</hi> If a day of holy reſt were inſtituted by God the Father in memory of the worlds Creation, which was the leſſe; much more was there a day of holy reſt inſtituted by God the Sonne in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the worlds redemption, which was the greater.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Certaine it is, that nothing, but divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, can bind, and overcome the Conſcience in regard of any outward obſervations, in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures indifferent; for the Conſcience is a Throne, in which God only ſits, and commands. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is bound, and over-awed to the obſervation of the Lords day; as all men confeſſe, and feel by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, unleſſe they bely their conſciences. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> That day, which the Church obſerveth in regard of ſome myſticall ſignification therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is a part of Gods worſhip; and muſt therefore be under precept, unleſſe we will worſhip God after our own fancies; But the Church obſerves the Lords day in regard of ſome myſticall doctrine therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the Lords reſurrection, our own future glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; therefore it muſt be under precept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> Whatſoever is not under divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is mutable, and may utterly be aboliſhed in the Church of God by the authority of the Governors thereof; but the Lords day cannot by any humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority whatſoever be changed, and aboliſhed. Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> If the obſervation of the Lords day be not of divine, but only Eccleſiaſticall conſtitution, then are all feſtivalls, or holy-daies of the yeare of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall dignity, and honour with it: But it were little
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7847:90"/>leſſe then blaſphemy to affirme the latter; and clean contrary to that of<note n="o" place="margin">Ignatìus Ep. ad Magne ſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos circa me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium epiſtolae.</note> 
                  <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who lived, &amp; wrote in the pureſt times, ſtyling it the <hi>Queene of daies</hi> Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirteenthly,</hi> It's only the divine prerogative of God himſelfe, to put holineſſe into times, and daies; for he only is the fountaine of holineſſe. But the Lords day is an Holy-day, and hath holineſſe in it, more then other daies; whence it is, that the Fathers frequently call it Sacred, Myſticall, Religiouſly to be obſerved: Therefore doubtleſſe made holy by God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourteenthly,</hi> None can appoint any thing to be a part of Gods worſhip in the Church, but Chriſt, who is the head of the Church, to rule and govern her; who can command the ſpouſe, but the husband? But the obſervation of the Lords day is a ſpeciall branch of Gods worſhip in the Church; therefore none can, none ought to inſtitute it, but Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifteenthly,</hi> There <hi>being a change of the Prieſthood, there was alſo a change of the Law, ſaith the</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixteenthly,</hi> Only Chriſt is Lord of the Sabbath, to appoint, and diſpoſe thereof as he thinks good; the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7847:90"/>Church can claim no ſuch Lordſhip; but the Sabbath is changed, and another appointed in the place thereof, which the whole Church obſerveth; this change therefore was made by Chriſt, not the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventeenthly, Old things are paſſed away, all things are become new,</hi> ſo the<note n="q" place="margin">2. Cor. 5.17.</note> Apoſtle. The meaning is, that Chriſt hath made all things new in his Church, as new Creatures, new Man, new Covenant, new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, new Way, new Names, new Song, new Garments, new Hieruſalem, new Heaven, new Earth. But unleſſe Chriſt hath alſo made a new Sabbath, he hath not made all things new. <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighteenthly,</hi> It is no way to be beleeved, that Chriſt would leave his Church under the Goſpell in worſe condition, then he found the Synagogue under <hi>Moſes;</hi> But if Chriſt left not his Church under the Goſpell a Sabbath of Divine Inſtitution; he left it in a farre worſe condition, then he found the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, which received a Sabbath from God himſelf, as a ſpeciall token of his love; <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninteenthly,</hi> If Chriſt hath left us no day of his own appointment, and Inſtitution, it were our ſafeſt way to turne Iewes (as ſome have done upon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motive, at leaſt in this point) for the Iewes day we are well aſſured was from God; but we may ſay of the Lords day, as they did of the Lord himſelfe, <hi>we know not whence it is;</hi> But no man will ſay it is beſt for us to turne Iewes in this point; <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twentiethly,</hi> The very Name is a ſufficient demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7847:91"/>of a Divine Inſtitution; for all things belonging to Gods worſhip, which have the Lords own name ſtamped upon them, were ordained by the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; as the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Lords Supper &amp;c.</hi> But the obſervation of the Chriſtian Sabbath is a thing appertaining to Gods worſhip, and hath the Lords own name engraven upon it by the<note n="r" place="margin">Rev. 1.10.</note> holy Ghoſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The one and Twentieth,</hi> That which Chriſt did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly inſtitute in his own perſon, and with his own mouth ordaine, muſt needs be of divine inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But that Chriſt did immediatly in his own perſon inſtitute the Lords day, the<note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 20.19.22.</note> Evangeliſt makes appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; for he came into the midſt of his Diſciples (the holy aſſembly) the two firſt daies of the two firſt weekes; then he bleſſed them, breathed on them; gave them the keyes of the Kingdome: It's very likely he did this every firſt day of the week from his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to his Aſſenſion,<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 1.2.3.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>The three and twentieth</hi> makes it more evident, thus: Whatſoeuer is an Apoſtolicall tradition, is of Divine Inſtitution; for they deliuered nothing, but what they firſt receiued; But the Lords-daies obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is certainly an Apoſtolicall tradition,<note n="*" place="margin">1.

And ſurely were it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, ſo that a man ſhould diſtinguiſh betweene a divine precept, and a divine ordination (as the Ieſuite <hi>Lainez</hi> did in the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>) what a wide

               <p>Secondly, if Chriſt had given any command to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Sabbath, and in its roome to obſerue the Lords day; the Apoſtles, holding their firſt Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node, would doubtleſſe haue expreſſed as much in their letters to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for they profeſſe by that their decree, to lay upon them all neceſſary burthens in regard of outward obſervations.

Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whatſoever is of divine inſtitution, and (as they ſay) by neceſſity of precept laid upon the whole Church of Chriſt, is to be obſerved, as a neceſſary meanes unto ſalvation by the particular members thereof, unleſſe we be debarred therefrom by ſome inevitable impoſſibility; for he that is guilty of one, is guilty of all. But that the obſeruation of the Lords day, ever ſince Chriſts reſurrection, or aſcenſion, hath been a neceſſary duty, without which, if it might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly haue beene obſerved, no ſalvation were to be had, were deſperate raſhneſſe to affirme.

The day is one thing, the duties are an other; theſe belong to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, preſerving, and encreaſing them in us: that is but a circumſtance of time, and of it ſelfe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this reſpect. All things of this nature, as time, place, manner, are not (preciſely, and of themſelues conſidered) of the eſſence, or neceſſity of grace; and therefore are not commanded in the Goſpell, but left to the wiſdome, and deſcretion of the Church.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:7847:95"/>
               <p>Fiftly, that day, which cannot be kept univerſally through the whole world, was never commanded the whole Church of Chriſt by an Evangelicall Law; for the law of the Goſpell is given to all nations. But the firſt day of the weeke, which is the Lords day, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in memory of the Lords reſurrection, cannot be thus univerſally kept, conſidering the diverſity of Meridians, and the unequall riſing, and ſetting of the Sunne in diverſe Climates in the world. Some of our adverſaries foreſaw this objection, but could never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd it; only they tell us, that it was ſo with the Iewes in regard of their Sabbath; and therefore<note n="d" place="margin">Practice of piety.</note> affirme, that they were not bound to keepe their Sabbath upon that preciſe, and juſt diſtinction of time, called the ſeventh day from the Creation. For the Sunne ſtood ſtill in <hi>Ioſuah's</hi> time; it went back ten degrees (fiue houres) in <hi>Hezekia's</hi> time; beſides the variation of the Climates throughout the world. Vpon this they inferre two things. 1. that God by his prerogatiue might diſpence with men in theſe caſes: 2. that the Commandement meaneth not the determinate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth from the Creation, but indefinitely a ſeventh. But what abſurdities doe hence follow?</p>
               <p>Firſt, they ſeem to affirme, that the ſtanding ſtill, and the going back of the Sunne, made an alteration in the day, as it was the ſeventh from the creation. Indeed they made it longer, and to conſiſt of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number of houres for the preſent; but what is this to the number of ſeven? One and the ſelfe ſame day may be longer in Summer, ſhorter in Winter, yet
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7847:95"/>keeps its ranke amongſt the other daies of the week for place, and number.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they affirme that the Iewes were not bound to any determinate day, not to this ſeventh, but a ſeventh. Expreſly contrary to the words of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 20.10.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſeventh is the Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is the ſame reaſon in all the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med particulars between the Iewes Sabbath, and the Chriſtians. If therefore their day were indefinitely a ſeventh, ours muſt alſo be indefinitely a firſt; and by this meanes they ſay, and unſay with one, and the ſame breath; the firſt day is our Sabbath by divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and yet not the firſt, but a firſt; which is to yeeld the queſtion.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, there is the ſame reaſon of keeping a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate ſet Sabbath under the Goſpell, that there is of preaching, praying, and adminiſtring the Sacraments, Ordaining of Miniſters, doing works of mercy at ſet-times. For I think no man is ſo farre infatuated with this paradox, as either to preferre the Sabbath before theſe: or to ſever the day from the duties, which are the main end of the daies obſervation. But all theſe are commanded in generall, not preſcribed in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar when, or where, or how; ſo all things be done decently, and in order; We no where read how often in a year we muſt receive the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper; how often we ſhould hear a Sermon: or when to give, or how much either publikely, or privatly. If therefore there be no ſet times appointed for the maine duties of religion under the Goſpell, there is
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7847:96"/>no ſet time appointed to be kept <hi>Sabbath.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That, which is expreſly againſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty, was never commanded by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles; but to have the conſcience burthened with any outward obſervations, putting Religion in them, as being parts, and branches of Gods worſhip, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt Chriſtian liberty; for how is he free, that is thus bound to times, and daies? We have then only exchanged, not ſhaken off the Iewiſh bondage. If any man ſay, that this was both the argument, and error of the <hi>Patrobruſians</hi> of old, and <hi>Anabaptists</hi> of late; he is much miſtaken, for they pretend not to Chriſtian liberty, when the conſcience is not burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned immediatly from God; but to unchriſtian licence, and confuſion, to be exempted from the lawes of men, and decent order of the Church.</p>
               <p>Eightly, There is no duty, I think, eſſentiall in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ordained by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, of which we find not either exhortations in reſpect of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: or reprehenſions in regard of their neglect, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> the <hi>Acts,</hi> or the <hi>Epiſtles;</hi> But the keeping of the firſt day of the week Sabbath, is no where preſſed, or exhorted unto; the neglect thereof no where reproved, or forbidden in all the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

Whereupon theſe things will neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. That either the Apoſtles never held this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be a divine precept: or that having given it for ſuch to the primitive Chriſtians in the Churches planted by them, they never failed in the obſervation thereof; which is not imaginable, conſidering what groſſe abuſes, and prophanations were found amongſt them: or laſtly, that the Apoſtles knowing the Lords day, which they had injoyned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a divine precept, to haue been neglected, winked &amp; connived thereat; though ſo ready (even with the rod) to reforme all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſorders; which alſo cannot be well conceived.</p>

By their going to Law therefore they not only ſcandalized the Goſpell, and devoured one another; but were alſo prophaners of that day, which Chriſt himſelfe had Commanded to be kept holy; it being impoſſible at once to keep a Sabbath, and attend a Court of Iudicature under an Heathen Iudge. But the Apoſtle makes not the leaſt mention of this circumſtance, though ſo pregnant and

Sure it is, that whatſoever is of divine ordination, muſt be ſo, either from God the Father in the law of nature, or ſome poſitive precept of the old Teſtament: Or from God the Sonne, in ſome precept of the Goſpell: or from God the holy Ghoſt inſpiring the Apoſtles,<note n="*" place="margin">Iohn 16.13.</note> 
                  <hi>leading them,</hi> according to the promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all truth.</hi> Some therefore affirme a divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords day from God the Father, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves upon the morality of the letter of the fourth commandement. But this, ſavouring too much of Iudaiſme, and the commandement ſpeaking pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely of another day, is generally exploded. Others
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7847:99"/>therefore pretend an inſtitution from God the Sonne by Evangelicall law; but being required to ſhew ſome word of Chriſts eſtabliſhing this obſervation, faile in their proof, and are taken upon a <hi>Nihil dicit.</hi> The third opinion therefore is now become moſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is an inſtitution from God the holy Ghoſt, in, and by the Apoſtles. And this tenent is wiſely taken up, it being ſuch a hiding place, out of which men cannot ſo eaſily be drawn, as out of the former; eſpecially conſidering, that they extend to this purpoſe Apoſtolicall inſpirations to the uttermoſt latitude; for they were inſpired (ſay they) what, and how to teach the Church in all things. And theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, whenſoever they became notified to the Church, were, and are to be eſteemed divine inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whether written, or not written in Scriptures; wherein they ſeeme to imitate young Reſpondents in Philoſophy, who uſe to ſhelter themſelves under the ſecret qualities of naturall things, which they know their Opponents cannot eaſily diſcover: Or rather they are glad to plow with a Popiſh Heifar, <hi>(Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)</hi> of which<note n="a" place="margin">Sacra noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trorum an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chora eſt, ubi nulla ſuppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat noſtrarum falſitatum probatio.

               <p>For the better clearing therefore of this point, it is neceſſary ſomething be ſaid; Firſt of Apoſtolicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations; Secondly of Apoſtolicall traditions. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt, the Apoſtles, we all know, ſuſtain'd a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7847:99"/>threefold perſon. For we may conſider them either as Apoſtles, by extraordinary miſſion ſent to plant the Goſpell: or as ordinary Paſtors to govern the Churches already planted: or thirdly as private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. As Apoſtles, they were infallibly inſpired with all truths upon all occaſions, which might plant the kingdome of Chriſt, and bring men unto the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the faith; the end of their miſſion being to beare abroad Chriſts name. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they were alſo furniſh't with the gifts of Tongues, Miracles, Healings, Diſcerning of Spirits, being immediatly directed by the holy Ghoſt. As Paſtors, they had a twofold worke; Firſt, to perform the duties of the man of God, exhorting, reproving, correcting, inſtructing in righteouſneſſe; Secondly, as Elders, to rule well, erecting ſuch goverment in their planted Churches, as might beſt ſort with the times, and ſtates, in which they lived. Thus conſidered, no doubt but they were alſo inſpired; but not in like manner, nor meaſure as before. For their inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as paſtors, were only ſuch irradiations, influences, and concurrences of the Spirit, as are afforded at this day to the Paſtors of the Church; unleſſe by ſome perſonall miſcarriages they procure unto themſelves ſpirituall derelictions. Thus the ſpirit is at this day preſent in all Eccleſiaſticall Synods, nay even with private miniſters, uſing the right meanes in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, even in their privat labours. For the promiſe of Chriſt reacheth alſo unto them, and he is preſent with them unto the end of the world; Where notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7847:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>we muſt remember, that as all dictates of Eccleſiaſticall Synods, or dictates of private Paſtors, are not to be eſteemed divine precepts, becauſe they are ſubject to error: as daily experience makes it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, even in ſuch perſons, and aſſemblies, as are moſt regular; nay when their reſolutions are moſt confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the word of God, yet they are not divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: So it muſt be conceived of the Apoſtles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the Churches Paſtors, without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment at all to their Apoſtolicall dignitie. We know, that even the Apoſtles, conſidered as Paſtours, were ſubject to miſtake; as appeares by<note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 3.11.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> will giue him ſatisfaction, ſaying, it was to adde the more weight, and authority to his words, in oppoſition to the falſe Apoſtles, who were crept into the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and undervalved S. <hi>Pauls</hi> judgment. But obſerve, whether S. <hi>Paul</hi> to vindicate his reputation againſt them, ſaith more, or as much, as ſome of our adverſaries ſay of themſelves, upon all occaſions, when their dictates come to be queſtioned. Are not we (ſay they) the faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God, men more ſpirituall, then others, who uſe not to miſlead our people? And are not our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, men, that ſeeke themſelves, that pleaſe the times, having all the marks and characters of falſe Prophets? Whereas the words of the Apoſtle exceed not the bounds of a modeſt, and juſt defence.</p>
               <p>But it will be farther objected, that by this meanes we bring in the Papiſts Evangelicall counſels, if any things were delivered by the Apoſtles in Scripture, which are not precepts.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:7847:101"/>
               <p>I anſwer, that this is a meere calumniation. For theſe Evangelicall counſels, upon which the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts build their works of merit, and ſupererrogation, are (they ſay) Counſels of perfection; by embracing of which they become higher in Gods favour, and haue done more, then is required at their hands; for which they ſhall be more extraordinarily rewarded in Gods kingdome, and by which they daily augment the Churches treaſury. Such counſels we utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime, notwithſtanding the Apoſtles haue adviſed many things of themſelves in Scripture. Inſpired then the Apoſtles were as Paſtors; but theſe were not divine conſtitutions. And hence it comes to paſſe, the goverment, which they erected (for this appertained not to their Apoſtolicall, but Paſtorall charge) was no ſetled, or binding conſtitution. Laſtly, directed alſo they were as private perſons, which belongs not to this place to enquire into.<note n="*" place="margin">Ex traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onum vinculo, quas à Chriſto acceptas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtoli ſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das reliquere, Eccleſia exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere fideles non poteſt; in aliis vero, quae Apoſtoli con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituerunt tanquam Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, poterit ſummus Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare ibid.</note> We muſt in the next place, enquire of <hi>Apostolicall traditions.</hi> Theſe the Papiſts themſelves, the great admirers and advancers of them, diſtinguiſh into two ranks.

Other <hi>Apoſtolicall traditions</hi> there are, (ſay they) which they received not from Chriſt, but were ſuggeſted unto them by the ſpirit, for the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7847:101"/>profit of the Church; and they inſtance in the faſt of Lent, and threefold immerſion in Baptiſme. Theſe they delivered as Paſtors, not Apoſtles; and may be diſpenced with, as occaſion ſhall require.

Theſe they receive for divine, but all other whatſoever they reject. It were to be wiſhed, that they had expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves in purer &amp; clearer tearmes; their <hi>ſumma capita</hi> are ſo obſcure, as if purpoſely deviſed not to be underſtood. For if they underſtand, by the cheife heads of things, the ſubſtance, and matter of the thing delivered, though in other words in Scripture, (as it ſhould ſeeme to be their meaning, by their inſtances in the Apoſtles Creed, childrens Baptiſme, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens communicating) they ſpeak of things vnder precept, and concurre with us in our diſtinction. But if they underſtand by cheife heads, whatſoever is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and mentioned in the writings of the Apoſtles, (as it ſeemes they alſo doe, by inſtancing the Lords-daies obſervation) then muſt they alſo receive Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Vnction, the ſelling of poſſeſſions, having all things common, the Presbytery for Apoſtolicall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions neceſſarily to be received; for all theſe haue generall ground, and footing in Scripture. But to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7847:102"/>draw towards a concluſion in this poynt, according to the doctrine of the <hi>Traditionaries</hi> themſelves, we affirme theſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the obſervation of the Lords day is no divine <hi>Traditions,</hi> delivered by Chriſt immediatly to his Apoſtles, to be laid as a neceſſary duty upon his Church; and the reaſon is, becauſe its no where ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by them in the <hi>Acts,</hi> or in the <hi>Epiſtles;</hi> and becauſe it is no Article of faith, or practice neceſſary to ſalvation. Neither haue they, which haue gaineſaid, ever been reputed for <hi>Heretiques</hi> by the Church, or any ſober minded man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſay notwithſtanding, that it is very probable (for probability is our ſureſt ground) that the Apoſtles commended this day unto the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of thoſe times in honour of Chriſts reſurection, and giue it the title of <hi>Lords day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that they never impoſed it upon the Church, as a neceſſary obſervation; nay that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obſerved it not in thoſe places, where the Iewes had Synagogues, and obſerved their Sabbath, unleſſe it were for breaking of bread in the Lords ſupper, with reſervation of Chriſtian liberty.</p>

               <p>To the firſt, plaine it is that the fourth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is miſalleadged; for neither a ſeventh, nor one of ſeven, but that particular ſeventh, which was given unto the Iewes is there ſpoken of.

                  </note> many of the ancients ſtile it. If we ſtill confine our ſelues to the compaſſe of a weeke, and withall diſſolue the reference, which one day hath to another in regard of the Creation, we may make it any other number, what we pleaſe. Laſtly this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuppoſeth the queſtion. <hi>viz.</hi> That God hath commanded the Church of Chriſt, under the Goſpel, one of ſeven, and this in particular, to be kept Sabbath; whereas all outward obſervations, which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in generall, are left to the wiſedome of the Church, when we once deſcend to particulars.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, It is moſt true, that all particulars are included under their generals; but this doth not inferre, that he, who commandeth a generall duty, doth thereby alſo preſcribe the manner, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of particular actions, contained, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vnder that generall. For example, it is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall precept (at leaſt to ſuch as it appertaines, for the unletter'd (I thinke) it binds not) to reade, and ſearch the Scriptures. But I hope, the<note n="*" place="margin">Acts. 8.32.</note> 
                  <hi>Eunuch,</hi> when he did this in his chariot, was not bound at that time to read that particular paſſage in the Prophet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the perſon of Chriſt. The Apoſtles were commanded in generall to ordaine Paſtors, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; were they therefore commanded to chooſe <hi>Timothy</hi> in particular? We are bid to giue almes of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7847:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>that which we doe poſſeſſe; but our particular diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution to his, or that man, at this, or that time, is in our owne diſcretion. <hi>Honour the King,</hi> is a generall precept; but this binds us not to receive ſuch, or ſuch a particular man for our King: but he being by the grace of God our anointed Soveraigne, the precept, which before was generall, becomes now a particular tye, and binds us to honour him. So here, the fourth precept commands to ſanctifie ſome ſet time for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique worſhip; doth it therefore command the firſt day of the weeke to be that time? To keepe ſome time is one things, this generall is under divine precept: to keepe this, or that time, is another thing, this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is left unto the wiſdome of the Church. And thus<note n="o" place="margin">Exemplum ſit in genicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione, quae ſit dum ſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes habentur precationes; qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> M. <hi>Calvin</hi> doth affirme, that one, and the ſame thing may both be a divine precept, and a humane conſtitution in different reſpects. He gives inſtance, in kneeling at the Communion, and at publique prayers in the congregation. The queſtion is, whether they are humane <hi>Traditions;</hi> thou muſt anſwer (ſaith he) that it is both humane, and divine; it's a divine ordinance, being comprehended under that decency comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Apoſtle in generall: and it is a humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, in regard of the particular deſignation of this, or that geſture. Indeed when the particular is once appointed either for days, or geſture, or any other outward obſervation, the generall precepts binds us to thoſe particulars. If therefore this argument can hold for the manner of obſerving the Lords day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which is preſcribed by our Sabbatharians, well;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7847:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſure I am it concluds nothing for the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof.</p>
               <p>To the third, it is true, that one, and the ſame Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is many times twice fulfilled; but this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on holds only, when that Scripture ſpeaks either of Chriſt, and his Church: or of things, which were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Types of things to come. And laſtly, they are ſuch Scriptures, as the holy Ghoſt hath already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered vnto us; for we haue no warrant to follow our Pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>es herein. If therefore the letter of the fourth commandement be a prophecie of Chriſt, and his Church: or the <hi>Iewes</hi> Sabbaths were Types of the Lords day: or the holy Ghoſt hath in any place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed unto us, that what was ſpoken of the one, was intended by him of the other, we ſubſcribe to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; but till this be made appeare, it ſerves to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>To the fourth, this therefore comes timely in to ſecond his predeceſſour, but hath not that ſtrength, which might be wiſhed. For we vtterly deny, that ever the Lords day was prefigured, much leſſe precepted in the old Teſtament. Thoſe Rabinicall collections ſhall paſſe for dreames.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7847:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>we will thinke of an anſwer to this authority. The Synod of <hi>Matiſcon</hi> is more ancient then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and purpoſely held concerning the Lords day; here, amongſt other things, we have this paſſage; <hi>This is the perpetuall day of rest, which is knowne by the law and the Prophets: and inſinuated unto us by the ſhaddow of the ſeventh day.</hi> But that Synod intends no more, then the former (<hi>viz.</hi> That upon the day of Chriſts reſurrection we were admitted into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſt) appeares evidently by that which followes, it is<note n="ſ" place="margin">Iuſtum eſt, ut hanc diem celebremus, per quam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti ſumus, quod non fui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. Con. Matiſ, ubi ſupra.</note> but equall therefore, that we ſhould celebrate this day, by which we are made that, which we were not. Not therefore the keeping of the day it ſelfe, but the mercies of the day, peace, and liberty in Chriſt, is that, which the Synod affirmes to be intimated unto us in the Type, and to be knowne by the law, and the Prophets.</p>
               <p>To the fift, the day, of which the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, is literally the day, wherein <hi>David</hi> was ſetled in his Kingdome, and the unction of Samuell took effect. As if the prophet ſhould have ſaid; God long ſince an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed me to be King over his people: but this was a day, on which he decreed to ſettle me actually in my Kingdome. There is no queſtion, but that Pſalme is myſtically, &amp; ſpiritually to be underſtood, as well as litterally, of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Throne, as of <hi>David</hi> and his Scepter; one was a figure of the other. I deny not alſo, but that <hi>Davids</hi> day was a figure of <hi>Chriſts</hi> day, though it did not appeare, that <hi>David</hi> was ſetled in his Kingdome the ſame day of the week,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7847:107"/>that Chriſt roſe out of his grave; But underſtand the place how we pleaſe, all that can be gathered thence are but theſe three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that God had in his counſell determined a ſett day to performe his promiſe unto <hi>David,</hi> making him King of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that God had alſo decreed a ſett period of time, wherein Chriſt ſhould be exalted, and ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne of his glory in the Kingdome of the Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that as the Iewes had cauſe to rejoyce in the dayes of <hi>David,</hi> God having given them a man after his own heart: ſo the Chriſtians have much more reaſon to rejoyce in Chriſt their King, and to embrace the mercies of his glorious reſurrection. If any man now ſay, that either the ancient, or moderne <hi>Arnobius,</hi> mentioned in the argument, collect from hence the inſtitution of the Lords day; I anſwere, they find it there inſtituted no otherwiſe, then the whole Church hath ever found it, <hi>viz.</hi> Logically, becauſe they ground the obſervation of the day upon the mercy of the day; not morally, as being formally, and poſitively inſtituted either in that, or any other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>To the ſixt, we have here a well known fallacy, the effect being attributed to that, which is no way the true cauſe thereof. As when the wolfe in the fable quarrelled with the Lamb for troubling the water, when the Lamb ſtood all the while below the Woolfe in the river: And when the heathen in the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7847:107"/>daies of<note n="t" place="margin">Mala, quae civitas pertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit Chriſto imputant; bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> S. <hi>Austine</hi> charged the Chriſtian religion to be the cauſe of the ſcourge of the Goths, and Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls, and all other evills, which then afflicted the world. But to returne to our Opponents. I will only demand, whether God doth not bleſſe his ordinance unto his people upon Lecture daies, as well as upon Lords daies. If not, why are they in vaine ſo much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented; if ſo, then evident it is, that Gods ordinance may bleſſe the day, and make it happy unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But the day doth not bleſſe the ordinance unto us; the words in the Commandement (hath <hi>bleſſed</hi> and <hi>ſanctified</hi>) are <hi>Exegetically</hi> put, the one expounding the other.</p>
               <p>To the ſeventh, the example of God the Father, reſting from his works of creation, was that indeed, upon which the inſtitution of the Iewes Sabbath was grounded, but not the inſtitution it ſelfe. For to this there was required a law to be given, which was not untill the daies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the fall of Manna in the wilderneſſe. The like we alſo affirme of the example of God the Sonne, at the worlds redemption reſting from all his labours; for though it be not a Law inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting, yet it is ſufficient ground, and warrant, why it was at firſt inſtituted, and hath ever ſince been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>To the eight, all arguments of this kind from the leſſe to the greater are but probable, and muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of great, and leſſe in the ſame kind. For that, which is leſſe in one reſpect, may be greater in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it's ſo in this particular. For the creation of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7847:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>world is a greater work of power,<note place="margin">

Now ſuppoſe, that the argument ſpeak of the ſame kind of great, and leſſe, which yet it doth not; nothing can be concluded, becauſe the circumſtances of time, and perſons are not equall. For the Iewiſh Sabbath was given in the child-hood, and nonage of the Church, to a people of dull eares, ſtiffe necks, heavy hearts; to ſuch the appointing of a determinate time was neceſſary; but the children of the light, men of ripe eares, that have their eares bored, their hearts il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated, need no ſuch childiſh rudiments, as the obſervation of daies.

And this may be either from the ground, or reaſon of its obſervation; ſo it is ſaid by the<note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 19.31.</note> Evangeliſt, <hi>that the Sabbath was a high day,</hi> becauſe the feaſt of the paſſover fell upon that day by tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which was the manner of the Iewes, when any of their feaſts fell out to be the day before the Sabbath) and in this reſpect, we may call the Lords day the Queen of daies; becauſe it is kept in memory of Chriſts reſurrection, which is farre to be preferred, before any feſtivall celebration, in memory, and for imitation of any Saint whatſoever: Or, from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the publique worſhip, according to the cuſtome of the Church: Or laſtly, from the intention of the Church appointing, as when ſhe intends only halfe, or ſome part of the day to be kept holy, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all manner of works upon ſome daies, but allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them upon others, as Markets, and Faires. In this latter reſpect alſo, no Holy-day is equall with the Lords day, eſpecially in the Church of England, however it be in forraine parts; notwithſtanding if we look to the outward ſolemnity of Gods worſhip,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7847:109"/>ſome holy-dayes may be greater then it.</p>
               <p>To the thirteenth, that one day ſhould have more holineſſe in it then another, as it is this day, or that day, by divine inſtitution under the Goſpell, is a propoſition Atheologicall, and part of the Egyptian, and Iudaicall ſuperſtition, which the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians;</hi> and againſt which, S. <hi>Hierom</hi> reaſons irrefragably. For then this holineſſe, faith<note n="a" place="margin">Aut habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſanctita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ex lapſu ſyderum, aut Dei beneficio, aut hominum inſsituto.</note> hee, muſt be derived either from the motion, and influence of the heavens: or from the impreſſion of Gods holineſſe made upon it. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer no man will affirme; and for the latter if ever any ſuch impreſſion of Gods holineſſe were communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any day, doubtleſſe it was to the ſeventh from the Creation. But this in the time of the Goſpell, is accounted, but as other common daies. If any man ſay, it may receive its holineſſe from man; ſure we are that all the men in the world cannot make any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the world to be formally holy. Daies are well ſtiled holy by accident, and in regard of their end, and appointment, becauſe ſet a part for holy things; and no otherwiſe. And this agrees not only to the Lords-day, but to all Holy-daies whatſoever; and that equally, being all ſet apart by the ſame authority of the Church.</p>

Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more I anſwere, that if the exchange of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood had made only an exchange of the Law, putting one thing in the roome of another; Chriſtian religion ſhould now be as burthenſome, as the Iewiſh was heretofore; in regard of the number, though not for the quality of their obſervations; which how abſurd it is, appears at firſt ſight.</p>
               <p>To the ſixteenth, we all acknowledge Chriſt to be the Lord of the Sabbath, and of all things elſe in his Church. The Iewiſh Sabbath alſo is aboliſhed; yet it followes not, but this might be done by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church. For what? doth he, that is Lord in a houſe, doe all things with his own hands? In the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7847:110"/>houſe is nothing left to the power of wife, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? Chriſt indeed is Lord of the Church, gives orders with his own mouth concerning things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and ſubſtantiall; but he leaves ritualls, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonialls (ſuch as are time, place, manners of his worſhip) to his wife, and ſervants, the Church, and Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>To the ſeventeenth: no man denies, that * <hi>all things are become new,</hi> ſo we take the reſt of the text with us,<note n="*" place="margin">2. Cor. 5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>old things are paſsed away;</hi> for it was the paſſing of old things away, which maketh all things to become new. In the Goſpell all things are become new, no otherwiſe, then the reformed religion is ſaid to be new; becauſe it hath receded from the corruptions of Popery, which had a long while ſtuck to the Church: as an old ach lyes in the body. The Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Moſes are vaniſhed, things themſelves are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and this is the novelty there ſpoken of. But granting what the argument requireth, that all things are become, not only negatively, but poſitively new: as a new Teſtament, a new and living way. May not his ſpirit make other things new, as new hearts, new creatures? May not the Church alſo make ſome thing new: as new forme of goverment, new exerciſe of publique worſhip, with new circumſtances thereof? But as all things elſe are become new, ſo I wiſh theſe men would leave their old abuſing of Scripture, and think of a new, and better kind of reaſoning.</p>
               <p>To the eighteenth, that Chriſt hath left his Church, in worſe eſtate, then he found the Synagogue, becauſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7847:111"/>he hath not burthened it with obſervations of dayes, is a myſtery in Divinity. It is, as if a man ſhould ſay, the Heire is in worſt caſe, when he is Lord of all, then when being a Child he differed not from a ſervant, becauſe now he is no longer under Tutors, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours; this is ſuch a Paradox, as few Wards will beleive. To be freed from putting holyneſſe in dayes, is part of the liberties of the Sonnes of God, in which the Apoſtle wiſheth<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5.1.</note> 
                  <hi>vs to ſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the nineteenth, To turne <hi>Iewes</hi> therefore in this poynt, and upon this ground, becauſe they had a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of Gods owne appointing, and we haue not; were as great madneſſe, as for a Slaue, that is once manumitted to returne unto bondage. What if they had a day of Gods immediate appointment? Had they not alſo Prieſts, Veſtments, Sacrifices, a ſet day of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation yearely, &amp;c? If it be beſt to turne <hi>Iewe</hi> in one, why were it not ſo in all? But this needes not; for God hath hitherto, and ever will giue vs our appointed Feaſts, though from men, and by men, as he giues vs Prieſts, Altars, Temples, Sacrifices, and all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his worſhip, and ſervice.</p>
               <p>To the twentieth, many things have the Lords name ſtampt upon them, which never were of Gods immediate, &amp; particular appointment. Our Churches are called the houſes of God; our Communion-table, the Lords table; our Miniſters, the Lords Miniſters; yet are none of theſe of immediate inſtitution from the Lord himſelfe, though all are ſuch as appertaine to the Lords worſhip. It is an old rule, <hi>à nomine ad
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7847:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>rem non valet argumentum,</hi> from the name to the thing the argument doth conclude.</p>
               <p>To the one and twentieth, concerning our Saviours keeping of the Lords day with his Diſciples, as their Paſtor, after his reſurrection, enough hath already been ſpoken; and the Scriptures alleadged haue been alſo cleared, in which there is not any one footſtep of an inſtitution.</p>
               <p>To the two and twentieth, its moſt true, that Chriſt, after he was riſen, was fortie daies on the earth, and converſed diverſe times with his Diſciples, which times are particularly ſet downe in the hiſtory. He gave them alſo inſtructions, and commands, but theſe are alſo upon record. They were of two ſorts, either ſuch, as belong to their Apoſtolicall function, as<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 28.19.</note>

                  </note> no man can ſhew, when the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and Chriſtians ſevered their aſſemblies. Secondly, many particular Churches varied one from another, in this poynt, as it hath been ſaid, Thirdly, the Lords day was never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as a Sabbath, with ceſſation from works, till <hi>Conſtantines</hi> edicts commanded it; which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards enlarged, or reſtrained by Eccleſiaſticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. That the Primitive Church, in the time of perſecution, obſerved the Lords day as a Sabbath, hath no ground at all in Scripture; and is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant unto reaſon; becauſe certaine it is, that they kept the Iewiſh Sabbath, till the Synagogue was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. Neither is it likely, that they kept two daies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: or if they did, is it probable, that neither the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhould quarrell at this obſervation: nor the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> who derided the <hi>Iewes</hi> for miſpending the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth part of their lives in idleneſſe, note it in the Chriſtians, over whom they held watchfull eyes? Or is it likely, that the Primitive Fathers, who wrote Apologies for the Church, either to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> or againſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in which they expreſſed the whole carriage of the Church, ſhould never ſo much as mention this daies obſervation, as taken up, and kept, as the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Sabbath, by divine inſtitution? If we conſider Sabbath duties named in the argument, certaine it is, that they preached no more, nor ſo much on that day, as they did upon others; for this they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies did on the <hi>Iewes</hi> Sabbath, becauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people. S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſermon upon the day of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7847:112"/>
                  <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> which was the Lords day, was accidentall; occaſioned by thoſe that mocked at them, and their gifts of tongues. S. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſermon at <hi>Troas</hi> hath beene already examined; and as for their collections on the Lords day I wonder from whence it ſhould be ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conceived, that they were then either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or made. S. <hi>Paul</hi> bids the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indeed provide a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence for the poore Saints at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> againſt his comming; and that they might be in readineſſe, he wils every man, the<note n="*" place="margin">1, Cor. 16.2.</note> 
                  <hi>first day of the weeke, to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by himſelfe;</hi> not, to collect in the aſſembly. So that this being a particular occaſion, was particularly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Apoſtle, as their wiſe Paſtor; not, as a ruled caſe to bind the Church for ever. Nay farther, we may affirme, that collections are no eſſentiall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Lords day; neither are they ſo eſteemed, and uſed in moſt congregations, living as we doe in a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led eſtate, wherein the law hath provided for the poore in another kind. The Sacrament of the ſupper was indeed conſtantly adminiſtred every Lords day; but the reaſon was no way Sabbatharian; for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, being the badg of Chriſtianity, could not be received in the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Synagogue, wherein they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed other duties. Beſides, they much miſtake, which judge of their Communions, by ours; as if they only received upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reſting daies, with ſermons before, and collections after; they only met together in ſome private Chamber to break bread, without any more adoe. And this they did upon the Lords day, as moſt ſutable to that ſervice, wherein Chriſt was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7847:113"/>Laſtly, admitte all the argument requires; we have only the ancient practice of the Church; but this makes no divine inſtitution; by the confeſſion of them, that moſt advance the Churches power,<note n="e" place="margin">Non ideò ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid eſt iuris divini, qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To the foure and twentieth, That the Apoſtles ſhould be guilty themſelves, and make the Church guilty of ſo damnable a preſumption, as this argument ſpeaketh of, were indeed a blaſphemous conſequence; but the beſt is, this terrible inference hath no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at all with the antecedent, the reputed Father thereof. For what was the preſumption of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> figures of that, which ſhall be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Antichriſt?</hi> But the changing of thoſe times, which God appointed to be obſerved by his Church, commanding others to be kept in their places, and that out of impious, and blaſphemous intentions, to ſubvert true Religion, and to ſet up Idolatry in the roome thereof? Did the Apoſtles ſo? God forbid. But the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Sabbath being expired, and having breathed out its laſt gaſpe, that the publike worſhip of God might be upheld with decency, and order, they commanded the obſervation of the Lords day unto the Primitive Chriſtians; which hath no likeneſſe at all, with thoſe things here ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>To the five and twentieth, It is true, that the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of holy men in Scripture, not ſeconded by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, bindeth not the conſcience; only their example ſheweth us the lawfulneſſe, and expediency of the things practiſed upon like occaſions, with like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7847:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>and this is our warrant for obſerving the Lords day. But for deſpiſing the Saturday-ſabbath, we have more then the naked practice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. For in all their <hi>Epiſtles</hi> they proclaime all <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> ordinances, (and ſuch was that <hi>Sabbath</hi>) to be ceaſed under the Goſpell; Chriſt, who was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, being come.</p>
               <p>To the ſix and twentieth, Whether <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> fell on the Lords day, is queſtioned by ſome, and denied by many; their reaſon is, <hi>becauſe the fifty daies were to begin the morrow after the Paſſover. Levi.</hi> 23.16. But plaine it is, that our Saviour did eate the <hi>Paſſover</hi> upon Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-night; and ſo Saturday, the <hi>Iewes</hi> Sabbath, muſt be the firſt, and laſt from the fifty daies. To avoyde this objection,<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>In Ex. c.</hi> 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Rupertus</hi> reads the text; <hi>Thou ſhalt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from the next day after the Sabbath,</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it of the Sabbath properly ſo called, or weekely Saturday-ſabbath; and ſo our Lords day, being the next following, is made the firſt, and the laſt of the fifty. But this is a plaine miſtake of the text. For the firſt day of <hi>unleavened bread,</hi> being commanded to be a Sabbath, is that Sabbath there ſpoken of, from whence they were to begin their account. Secondly, therefore others interpret thoſe words; <hi>(Thou ſhalt number fifty dayes)</hi> from the firſt day of <hi>unleavened bread,</hi> (for not only the firſt, but the laſt alſo of thoſe dayes was a Sabbath) excluſively, ſhutting out the firſt day after from the beginning of the number of the fifty; and by this meanes they bring it alſo to be the Lords day. But whether doth this hold; for the

This being done, they begin to account from that great, or high day, and ſo the Lords day was the firſt, and laſt of thoſe fifty. But when all this ſtirre is made about the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> on which the holy Ghoſt was given; firſt this fell out by meere accident, and from the ſuperſtitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of this people concerning their Sabbaths, that it was not lawfull for them in them to bury the dead. Secondly, what looſeneſſe is in the concluſion gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any thing from any thing? The holy Ghoſt was given on that day, therefore it was a Sabbath of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution.</p>
               <p>To the ſeven and twentieth, This alſo ſavours of the like looſeneſſe. Indeed if God did never reveale himſelfe unto his Prophets, but on Sabbath dayes, the inference were tolerable; but this I thinke no man will affirme. I preſume, God revealed as much to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> in his kind, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his; muſt therefore the daies of <hi>Daniels</hi> revelations be Sabbaths? Beſides, who can tell, whether the Lords day, of which S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:7847:114"/>ſpeaks, were the Lords day, which we keepe: or Eaſter day, the ſolemnity of Chriſts reſurrection, which <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> &amp; his Diſciples obſerved, as it fell out according to the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> ſupputation?</p>

For<note n="*" place="margin">Eſa. 55.8.</note> Gods wayes are not as mans, but ſecret, and unſearchable, &amp; his judgements paſt finding out. But in this place it is as fallacious, as preſumptuous; affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Non cauſam pro cauſa,</hi> aſſigning that to be the cauſe of the judgements, which is not. For the day is one thing, the prophanation, irreligious contempt of Gods ordinances appointed upon that day by the Conſtitutions of the Church, and the law of the Land, is another. Theſe indeed be ſinnes highly provoking Gods wrath; but no reſpects, which God hath to this day more then to another, doth pull down his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And therefore I doubt not, but if the day were changed into any other, there would be as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary judgements of God revealed from heaven, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this kind of ungodlineſſe of men, as ever were in any ages upon the Lords day.

                  <hi>CAP. XXI.</hi> A preparatiue diſcourſe to the two maine queſtions which follow, concerning the obſervation of the Lords day.</head>
               <p>HAving examined the originall, and inſtitution of the Lords day; it remaines only, that in the laſt place wee enquire after what manner it ought to be obſerved in the Church; &amp; what be thoſe duties of the day, unto which in particular the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is bound under the penalty of ſinne. For how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this be the laſt concluſion in our adverſaries po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, yet it is the firſt in their intentions; and I doubt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7847:115"/>not, but they would willingly ſhake hands with us in all the reſt, might this be yeelded. Neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that this be knowne; not only for the ſatiſfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many weake conſciences, who are wavering herein, and therefore daily wounded: but alſo for the better according of theſe Queſtions formerly diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But ſhould we be exact in the diſcuſſing hereof, it would proue to be a <hi>Hydra</hi> of many doubts. For it being agreed betweene us, that the whole obſervation of the Lords day doth conſiſt in a <hi>Dichotomy,</hi> being divided betweene reſt, and holineſſe; there ariſe out of both ſundry ſcruples, which may be ranged under theſe two heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, whether they be ioyntly, and equally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as eſſentiall duties: or whether the duty of holineſſe be eſſentiall, and that, wherein the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the day conſiſts. The duty of reſt being on the other ſide only accidentally commanded, as it ſtands in relation to the duties of holineſſe. Now ſuppoſing (as it is commonly taught) that corporall reſt, and ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation from workes is enioyned, as an eſſentiall dutie; it is neceſſary to know, in what meaſure, and degree it is required of us Chriſtians in the time of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; whether in that rigour, and ſtrictneſſe, as was exacted of the <hi>Iewes</hi> under the Law. And under this head come fiue particulars by name, about which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſputes haue beene raiſed amongſt the weake.</p>
               <p>Firſt, whether all workes of profit, which are not of abſolute neceſſity, be forbidden as ſinnes upon that day, how lawfull and commendable ſoever they be
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7847:116"/>upon other daies: as journyes, Harveſt workes, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trades.</p>
               <p>Secondly, works of pleaſure, &amp; honeſt recreations, in themſelues lawfull, and not prohibited by the Church, and State.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, works of the minde: as the ſtudying of Arts, and Sciences, which are not parts of Divinity, but only uſuall hand-maids thereof: as the tongues, Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, all conferences, diſcourſings, conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about things of common life, and meerely civill.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Whether a more liberall uſe of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in feaſts, and entertainments of friends, &amp; neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, either Anniverſary, as the feaſts of dedication of Churches; or occaſionall, as marriages, and Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-dinners be forbidden Chriſtian people, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanations of the Lords day.</p>
               <p>The ſecond generall head, and <hi>Lerna</hi> of perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is, whether the duties of holineſſe, by which the day is ſanctified, be only acts of the publique worſhip of God in the Congregation: or whether the private exerciſes alſo of Religion appertaine unto the day, as neceſſary, and immediate duties thereof; and that, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time? And under this head a world of particular caſes are raiſed alſo; and many times ſuch, as neither wiſe men, nor learned men would imagine: as daily appeares by experience to men of Paſtorall employment in the Church. But theſe, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named particulars being delivered as Magiſteriall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, and concluſions out of the former Poſitions;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7847:116"/>my purpoſe is, only to make enquirie into the two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall heads, under which they are contained. For theſe being weighed in the <hi>Ballance of the Sanctuary,</hi> and true iudgement, the reſt will evidence themſelues, as Corollaries.</p>

               <p>THat the outward bodily ceſſation from all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular employments whatſoever, is of it ſelfe a duty of the Chriſtians mans Feaſt-day, may ſeeme to be proved by many undenyable arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that, which is an eſſentiall duty of all Sabbaths in generall, is an eſſential duty of every Sabbath in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. But the Lords day is the Chriſtian mans Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, &amp; may ſo be called, though improperly, as hath beene formerly confeſſed; and bodily reſt is an eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all duty of all Sabbaths in generall: as appeares both by the very name of Sabbath, which ſignifies as much as ceſſation: and more expreſly by the letter of the fourth Commandement <hi>(In it thou ſhalt doe no manner of work)</hi> confirm'd by the<note n="a" place="margin">Exod, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.40.</note> 
                  <hi>The Law, and the Prophets.</hi> But the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:7847:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſaith, that <hi>thoſe, who will honour the Lord in his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, muſt not doe their owne works, nor follow their own pleaſures, nor ſpeak their owne words.</hi> In which three whatſoever may be any buſineſſe of our own is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden us on the Lords Sabbath, by which we honour him. <hi>Therefore. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, in all Lawes whatſoever, that is eſſentiall, and for its owne ſake commanded, for whoſe ſake other things in the Law are enjoyned, according to the common <hi>Maxime, Illud eſt perſe, propter quod eſt aliud.</hi> But many things in the fourth precept are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that this duty of utter ceſſation from all ſecular employments may be performed. For wherefore would God haue not only our Children, and ſervants reſt, but our beaſts alſo to reſt? unleſſe only, that all meanes, and occaſions of not reſting might be taken from the Parents, Maſters, and owners themſelues. <hi>Therefore. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly. All theft is directly, immediatly, and for its owne ſake forbidden; and of thefts, the cheife and capital is Sacriledge. But to work upon the Lords day is theft, nay ſacriledge; for we ſteale ſo much from God (this day being his) as we beſtow upon our ſelues, and our owne employments; whereas, on the contrary, by reſting on that day, we abſtaine from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and giue the Lord his own. <hi>Therefore. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, whatſoever doth immediatly hinder any thing, which God commandeth, is immediatly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the Negatiue of every Affirmatiue. This is a Maxime generally received in expounding the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7847:117"/>But all kinds of works upon the Lords day, whether ſerious, or luſorie, doe immediatly hinder that, which God commands, <hi>viz.</hi> To attend his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſervice, ſuffering him to work effectually in us by his word, and Spirit. This <hi>Moſes</hi> doth plainely teach us, in ſaying,<note n="*" place="margin">Lev. 23.3.</note> 
                  <hi>There ſhall no work be done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings &amp;c.</hi> Where firſt he repeats his Commandement, <hi>There ſhall no work be done therein.</hi> Secondly, he giues the reaſon, <hi>for it is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings.</hi> It is not poſſible for you to performe the duties of the Lords Sabbath; or that God ſhould work on you therein; unleſſe there be an utter ceſſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from all kindes of works. It ſtands alſo with reaſon, for worldly imployments ſteale away the heart from holy things; and according to our Saviours rule,<note n="*" place="margin">Mat, 6.24.</note> 
                  <hi>We cannot ſerue God, and Mammon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, that, which immediatly reſiſteth, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the Kingdome of God in us,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 14.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Which is righteouſneſse, peace, ioy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> muſt needs be immediatly and for its owne ſake forbidden by the Law of God. But all ſecular imployments of what nature ſoever upon the Lords day immediatly reſiſt, and ſubvert the kingdome of God in us. Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, take it how we will, either for the righteouſneſſe of juſtification, which is imputed: or righteouſneſſe of ſanctification, which is inherent, commeth by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, groweth by praier, is ſtrengthned by meditating, and conferring; not by journying, working, and ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Lords day; and the more theſe are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7847:118"/>by us on that day, the leſſe righteouſneſſe muſt needs be in us. The conſcience alſo is deeply woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſuch groſſe prophanations, if it be not ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe &amp; ſeared: as appeares by the confeſſions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, &amp; Penitents, and the Godly feele in themſelues by daily experience. And it cannot but diminiſh the joy of the holy Ghoſt; for this is chiefly fed, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by holy meetings, and godly exerciſes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Nay if it be true, which many learned men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme at leaſt for probable, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come to judgement on the Lords day. What little joy can any man finde in things earthly, and ſenſuall on the day, when, for ought he knowes, he may ſuddenly heare the voice of the Archangell ſummoning him before the Tribunall of the Lord, whoſe Sabbath he is then prophaning.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, if there were no law prohibiting works on this day, the very law of expediency were enough. For it's no way expedient on that day, to make ſuch a medly of things heavenly with things earthly, to mix the holy things of God with things prophane; baſe, and vile things with things honourable, and glorious; this were to make the Lords-day a garment of linſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woolſy. But the Lords day, and the duties thereof are things holy, heavenly, and glorious. All ſecular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments prophane, vile, contemptible. The<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 6.2.</note> Apoſtle calls the things of this life <hi>the ſmallest things.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Eightly, that, which was ever blaſted in all ages with ſome extraordinary curſe, &amp; remarkable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7847:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>is doubtleſſe not only unlawfull, but in an high manner abominable in Gods ſight. For the Lord<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 34.6.</note> 
                  <hi>being gracious, long-ſuffering, and ſlow to anger,</hi> doth not uſually reveale his wrath from heaven, but againſt ſome unſufferable ungodlineſſe of men. But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the Lords day by ſervile works hath beene ever thus blaſted; whether done about ſun-ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that day, and being a matter of no great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: or after evening prayer in the afternoone, to take away all evaſions from the circumſtance of time. Of this there hath beene much, and lamentable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ever ſince the Kings Declaration, he being confuted as it were herein by the King of Kings.</p>
               <p>Ninthly. The conſent of the whole Church ever ſince <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time: as appeares by the Edicts of that Emperour, with ſundry Synodicall conſtitutions in all ages; many wholſome ſtatutes made to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in all parts of the Chriſtian world. The Fathers alſo haue been large in the ſame argument, utterly condemning even thoſe ſpeeches, and conferences, which withdraw our mindes from the ſerious medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of what we haue heard in the congregation.<note n="a" place="margin">Chryſ.

                  <hi>CAP. XXIII.</hi> The Arguments for the Negative are alſo related?</head>
               <p>THE Negatiue alſo is ſupported by ſundry rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Firſt, that, which is not under any Law Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7847:119"/>or Poſitiue, can be no eſſentiall duty, unto which the conſcience is bound under the penalty of ſinne; for where there is no Law, there can be no Tranſgreſſion. But ceſſation from work upon the Lords day is under no Law Naturall, or Poſitiue; not naturall, for it is neither a principle in nature knowne unto all men: nor any concluſion to be deriv'd from any naturall principle; I meane ſuch a totall ceſſation, as is here queſtioned. For that men ſhould haue times of reſt, and refreſhing is naturall; that God ſhould haue part of our time ſequeſtred for his worſhip, is alſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall; but neither the queſtion, nor arguments produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced intend this naturall reſt, but an artiſiciall kinde of ceſſation, which our <hi>Sabbatharians</hi> haue fancied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelues, and cannot be knowne unto us, unleſſe by Revelation. Neither is it under any poſitiue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; for then it might be ſhewed in ſome Evangelicall writer, and we need not fly to the Law, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the old Teſtament; to which ſatisfaction will ſoone be given.</p>
               <p>Secondly: Nothing commanded the <hi>Iew,</hi> as a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, under <hi>Moſes,</hi> is, or can be an eſſentiall duty of Religion unto the Chriſtians in the time of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell. And the reaſon is plaine; for the ceremoniall law was the application of things, in their own natures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, to myſticall, and holy uſes; and otherwiſe there could be no diſtinction between Morall, &amp; Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall. But that utter, and totall ceſſation from works here ſpoken of was a ceremony commanded the <hi>Iew</hi> under <hi>Moſes,</hi> hath already been manifeſted. <hi>Therefore, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:7847:120"/>
               <p>Thirdly. That, which is not in it's ſelfe, &amp; in its own nature an act of Religion, cannot be in its ſelfe, and its own nature a univerſall Chriſtian duty, binding all men under the penalty of ſinne. But an utter ceſſation from bodily labour upon the Lords day, is not in its ſelfe, and its own nature, an act of Religion; for then it muſt be ſome part of Gods worſhip, inward, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; wherewith, if rightly performed, God is well pleaſed. But God (ſaith M. <hi>Calvin</hi>) is not taken with any bodily reſt, and ceſſation of his creatures preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of it ſelfe conſidered, upon what day ſoever; which I think all men of ſober mindes will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; it cannot therefore be of it ſelfe a Chriſtian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon the Lords day. If any man ſay, it is a part of Gods worſhip, being an ordinance commanded by him. Let him ſhew us any ſuch command for the Chriſtian feſtivall, and I will ſubſcribe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that, which of it ſelfe doth no way fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our ſpirituall edification in Chriſt, is not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duty, binding the conſcience upon any day. But corporall reſt from the works of our lawfull callings, doth no way further our ſpirituall edification. For if<note n="*" place="margin">2. Tim. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Bodily exerciſe profiteth nothing,</hi> bodily ceſſation profiteth leſſe.

I anſwer, that is not the thing in queſtion; for then it edifieth not by and of it ſelfe, but by and through the holy exerciſes. If it be further ſaid, that it doth edifie, remembring us of our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reſt required of us, and the eternall reſt promiſed
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7847:120"/>unto us. I anſwer, that this Edification proceedeth not from the<note n="d" place="margin">Significatio alia eſt divina, ſeu à Deo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus addita, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fiftly, if Chriſtian liberty extend it ſelfe to things of greater conſequence, carrying with them far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhew of divine command; then doubtleſſe we are much more free in things of leſſe importance. But we are left free under the Goſpell to many things of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weight, as Vowing, Faſting, Preaching, Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, receiving the Sacraments, Confeſſion. For all theſe are commended to Chriſtian Liberty, in regard of determinating circumſtances: as <hi>where, when, in what manner, how long, how often;</hi> And ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>whether at all;</hi> yet are things of greater importance, and haue more probability of Divine precept, then bodily ceſſation on the Lords day. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, that, which is not ſo much as mentioned in the new Teſtament for a Chriſtian duty, is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Chriſtian people under the penalty of ſinne. This muſt needs be true of all ſuch duties, which Chriſt, and the Goſpell hath brought in, impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church, as diſtinguiſhed from the Iewiſh Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue. But corporall reſt, ſuch as our <hi>Sabbatharians</hi> require upon the Lords day, is not ſo much as menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the new Teſtament; and yet the Lords day, &amp; the obſervation thereof was brought in, and impoſed upon the Church, as contra-diſtinguiſhed from the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7847:121"/>Iewiſh Synagogue. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly. Had this been an immediate Chriſtian duty, ſo eſſentiall as it's now made; doubtleſſe the firſt Chriſtians, living under perſecuting Emperours, would haue made as great a conſcience of this, as of any thing elſe whatſoever. Eſpecially, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the Lord himſelfe, to whom the day is devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and perſecution maks men ſtick cloſeſt unto Chriſt, and all Chriſtian duties commanded by him. But the Primitiue Chriſtians did all manner of works upon the Lords day under the perſecuting Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, unleſſe whilſt they aſſembled themſelves by ſtealth to break bread. This appeares by <hi>Conſtantines</hi> edict againſt working upon this day, wherein not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding are excepted all labours of Husbandry whatſoever. It is a true rule, that the manners, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of men, are the Mothers of the Lawes of Kings, and States. A law prohibiting the doing of any thing, is a ſtrong preſumption, that the thing was done; eſpecially, when the Law is exceptiue. Plaine therefore it is by the Law of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who was the firſt Chriſtian Emperour, that the Primitiue Chriſtians made not ceſſation from works upon the Lords day a matter of conſcience.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> The Queſtion is briefly vnfolded in nine Propoſitions.</head>
               <p>THE whole queſtion may be eaſily clear'd in theſe following propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I conceiue, it is out of all controverſy, that the outward reſt from all manner of works, as it is expreſſed in the letter of the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was of it ſelfe, preciſely conſidered, and without relation to any thing elſe, to the <hi>Iewes</hi> an eſpeciall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of religion, and part of Gods worſhip. For though it be true, which<note n="i" place="margin">Calvin in Levit. 19. <hi>v.</hi> 13.</note> M. <hi>Calvin</hi> hath obſerved upon theſe words of <hi>Moſes (You ſhall keep my Sabbaths, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence my Sanctuary)</hi> that God commanded them ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7847:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>from works, with reference to the duties of the Sanctuary, yet were it alſo of it ſelfe a Sabbath-dayes duty. For that, which is of its ſelfe, and for its owne ſake commanded, may alſo be made a ſubordinate du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to help, and further another duty. So Prayer, which is of it ſelfe a maine part of Gods worſhip, is made a ſubordinate help to encreaſe our dependance upon God, and to beget in our hearts an awfull reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his Majeſtie. It's ſo here; for alſo if it had ſtood commanded only in relation to the worſhip of the Sanctuary, why were they to begin it over night? where as nothing was done in the Sanctuary, till the next Morning. If any man ſay, that, which was done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer night, was only by way of preparation. He much deceived himſelfe; For the preparation is one thing, the Sabbath another. They had their preparation, and their prepreparation, which tooke up almoſt the whole day precedent; both of their owne invention. But they began not their Sabbath-reſt till after Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet in the evening. And howſoever they impoſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things upon themſelues of their owne Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by way of Preparation; yet the firſt uſe, and true end thereof was, to provide for themſelues what to eate upon the Sabbath; in which it was unlawfull for them to dreſſe any thing, or ſo much as to kindle a fire. Their over-nights reſt had no relation at all to the Sanctuary, but to their comming out of Egypt, the memory whereof they were commanded to ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize thereby. As therefore unleavened bread, the not Ploughing of their Land in the yeare of <hi>Iubile,</hi> were
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7847:123"/>neceſſary duties of the ceremoniall worſhip; ſo was the outward reſt in the fourth Commandement.

Thirdly, works alſo of neceſſity were allowed them; whether they were the neceſſities of nature: or caſuall, or accidentall neceſſities, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending themſelues from unexpected incurſions of their enemies. The lawfulneſſe of works of this kind they learned from deare bought experience; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> and the hiſtory of the <hi>Macchabees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I conceiue it alſo to be evident, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as works of mercy, and of neceſſity be of two ſorts; ſome, which are of extreame neceſſity, which cannot be deferr'd, if we hope to preſerue the being of our ſelues, and others: ſome, which are only of moderate, and convenient neceſſity, which may be put off, though with ſome loſſe, and detriment. The <hi>Iewes</hi> were allowed not only the former, but thoſe alſo of

As therefore in other things they ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly contracted the Law, and made it ſtraighter, then ever God intended: ſo in this they extended it, and made it larger, then the Letter of the Law could beare.</p>

               <p>Secondly, they had an expreſſe prohibition for matters of Cookery upon the Lords day. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.23. and therefore the day before was the Preparation to the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they were forbidden to carry Burthens on the day of their Sabbath too and fro: as appeares by<note n="*" place="margin">Nehem. 13.19.</note>

The Text tels us, they were hungry; and the place was not farre from the City. When our Saviour vſually healed men diſeaſed upon that day, and moſt of them carried their greife many yeares, I think, no man will ſay the diſeaſes would haue killed them, or growne mortall, had they not been taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very inſtant.

                  <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that our Saviour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any thing, which was contrary to the Law of the Sabbath, which God commanded his people by the Miniſtery of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And the reaſon hereof is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; for he was made under the Law, and performed perfect, and entire obedience thereunto. Neither can any man ſhew any particular in the Law Morall, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall, and Iudiciall, which he alwayes obſerved not; and therefore doubtleſſe he was as farre from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing with others, as he was in diſpenſing with himſelfe. Suppoſing therefore, that this had been a meanes to make his Miracles more illuſtrious; yet had the thing in its ſelfe been repugnant to the Law, he neither would haue permitted it in any, much leſſe haue commanded it ſo often; though to haue gayned both credit to his doctrine, and glory to his Miracles. He well knew, that evill is not to be done, that good may come thereof. But that, which is thus ſuppoſed, hath no ground, or ſhew of truth. For I conceiue it to be more rationall to affirme, that the differring of the taking up of their beds, and carrying of them to their owne houſes the next day, upon notice given thereof,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7847:125"/>a greater concourſe of people would haue been gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, to haue ſeene the ſight, and to haue glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryfied God for the ſame. But I doe not obſerue, that our Saviour affected either oſtentation, or publication of his Miracles, but <hi>pro renatâ</hi> ſhewed his glory in them, as occaſions offered themſelues.</p>
               <p>By this therefore, which hath been ſaid, our third Concluſion doth appeare: <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Iewes</hi> might lawfull haue done, whatſoever was, not only of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, but alſo of conveniency; unleſſe in ſuch things, as were expreſſely forbidden them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: Its alſo, as I conceiue, out of queſtion, that Chriſtian liberty hath freed us by the Goſpell, from ſome part at leaſt of the burthen of the Sabbath, in regard of the ſtrictnes of that reſt, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Iewes.</hi> This propoſition is found in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe tearmes in our Sabbatharians Treatiſes; unleſſe in ſome one, or two, who would perſwade Chriſtian people to <hi>Super-Iudaize,</hi> Keeping the Lords day in a ſtricter, and more preciſe manner, then ever the <hi>Iewes</hi> kept the Saturday Sabbath. But this being a ſtrange fancy, and almoſt ſingular; I truſt, this fourth concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo will paſſe without contradiction. And there is good reaſon it ſhould; for not only the reſt of the Sabbath, but the ſtrictneſſe of that reſt was Typicall: as hath been already ſhewed, prefiguring that accurate holineſſe, which God requires of his people, and that fulneſſe of joy, and perfection of happineſſe, unto which <hi>Chriſt</hi> admits us, that belieue his Goſpell. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the whole Chriſtian Church in all ages hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7847:125"/>this for an undoubted truth, and<note n="b" place="margin">Vacent tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani. Qui in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venti fuerint Iudatizare, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema ſint. Con. Load. c. <hi>29.</hi>
                  </note> abhorred a Iewiſh reſting on the Lords day, and ever accurſed it, where they found it. By this then it is plaine, that in the time of the Goſpell we are not only allowed the ſame things on our day of reſt, which were permitted the <hi>Jewes</hi> upon their Sabbath: but even thoſe things alſo, which they were expreſly inhibited. And if this be ſo, it muſt needs follow, that ſince no particular works are forbidden us, as were forbidden them; and in generall, works either of abſolute, &amp; extreme, or of moderate, and convenient neceſſity are allowed us, as well as them, no reſtraint at all lies upon us in things appertaining to common life.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, there is notwithſtanding a ceſſation from works required of Chriſtian people under the Goſpel upon all daies of their publique worſhip, and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. For nature her ſelfe teacheth all men (ſaith<note n="c" place="margin">Natura d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Gerſon</hi>) ſometimes to reſt from their owne imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to ſpend that time in the praiſes of God, &amp; prayer to him. This is evident of it ſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is ſcarce any Nation ſo barbarous &amp; void of reaſon, which obſerues not this Law written in their hearts, by ſequeſtring ſometime, or other to ſuch reſt. The <hi>Turks,</hi> nay the <hi>Indians</hi> haue their Sabbaths. And indeed theſe two, <hi>viz:</hi> to attend Gods publique worſhip, and at the ſame time to follow our own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, are incompatible, and imply a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as on the other ſide, to be taken up with our owne affaires, and neglect Gods publike worſhip, is open ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, and prophaneneſſe. This concluſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7847:126"/>will paſſe for currant upon both ſides alſo.</p>
               <p>Sixthly. Although the Law of nature, in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and Morall part of the fourth Commandement requires us to reſt upon the day of Gods publique worſhip; yet how long we are bound to abandon the labours of our callings either before, or between, or after the publique worſhip; is neither ſet down in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor can be determined by the Law of Nature. Generall directions the light of every mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will ſuggeſt unto him, and may be deduced out of the writen word; concluding, that whatſoever may hinder either the worſhip it ſelfe, or our profiting thereby, ſhould be forborne, and avoided. But when we deſcend to practice, no generall rule is, or may be given. For as they ſay, <hi>Practica eſt multiplex,</hi> and no Law can juſtly be framed of Particulars in this kinde. For all men are not alike of themſelues; that, which may be an impediment to one, may not hinder ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; more time is allow'd ſome men, though to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch but a little buſineſſe, then others need haue for weighty matters. How therefore to governe our ſelues therein, we muſt haue ſome other direction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the generall rule, and dictate of nature.</p>

               <p>Seventhly. Therefore it muſt needs be, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate time of ceſſation from works, together with the manner, in regard of the ſtrictnes thereof, is who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left to the power, and wiſdome of the Church, and Magiſtrate.

               <p>Eightly, Though it be a thing in it ſelfe lawfull to labour upon the Lords day, unleſſe in prohibited caſes by the publique Magiſtrate; yet it is not unlawfull for any to obſerue it with as great ſtrictneſſe, as ever the <hi>Iewes</hi> did; ſo that his obſervation be accompanyed with theſe conditions.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. XXV.</hi> The Arguments brought for the affirmatiue are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; and in particular that, which is drawne from the Iudgements of God, is handled more at large.</head>
               <p>THeſe Concluſions being thus premiſed, it will not be difficult to diſſolue the arguments for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly alleadged.</p>
               <p>To the firſt therefore I ſay, it is utterly untrue, that outward reſt, and ceſſation from ſecular employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is an eſſentiall duty of <hi>Sabbaths</hi> in generall, but of <hi>Sabbaths</hi> properly ſo called, which were only the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> weekly <hi>Sabbaths.</hi> And this thoſe very Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures uſed for confirmation doe make appeare, being all of them branches of the law Ceremoniall. The Lords day is a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but not properly ſo called,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7847:129"/>and as the word doth ſignifie, but Analogically, and in its proportion. And therefore the Chriſtian Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day is no where ſtiled by this name, either in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Antiquity: as hath already been declared. Laſtly we deny not, but there is a Reſt, which is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and eternall to all dayes of publique, and ſolemne worſhip: as it is laid downe in our fiſt Concluſion; but not as any eſſentiall duty, as eſſentiall is here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that is of it ſelfe, and its owne nature, without reference to the publique worſhip. For ſo it was to the <hi>Iewes</hi> in the fourth Commandement; and ſo our <hi>Sabatharians</hi> now make it, preſſing the Letter of that precept in the ſame, nay in a greater rigour, then ever it did binde the <hi>Iewes.</hi> This argument therefore is weake in all the parts thereof.</p>
               <p>The ſecond carrieth with it much weight with poore ignorant, well-minded people, as ſeeming to be the very words of the holy Ghoſt. But how both they, and the Text it ſelfe haue been abuſed, hath already been ſhewed, and need not here to be repeated. We will only adde what the argument it ſelfe ſuggeſteth, that the Prophet Commenteth upon the Law; and the Letter of the Law is wholy Ceremoniall: as hath alſo been declared.</p>
               <p>To the third. That the Reſt of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement was impoſed upon Servants, and Beaſts, to take away all occaſions of travaile from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and owners: or that this was intended by the Law-giver herein, is a groundleſſe fancy, and comes neere to wreſting, and perverting of Scripture. For
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7847:130"/>when the Law-giver ſhall with his owne mouth ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a reaſon of his owne Law, expreſſing what he aimed at in the ſeverall clauſes thereof; it is not only vanity, but preſumption in any other to ſhew the depth of his reach, to tell us of other reaſons, and thoſe directly contrary to his; and all this in his name, as being ſent from him with <hi>He ſaith.</hi> It is ſo in this particular. For God hath expreſſely expounded this clauſe in the Commandement, and ſhewed his aime therein; as firſt, that it was to remember them of their labours in Egypt, where they were ſervants, &amp; entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more like beaſtes, then men. Secondly, it was the Lords goodnes extending it ſelfe euen to the meaneſt of his Creatures, that their Servants, &amp; Cattle might be refreſhed as well as themſelues; not therefore for the Maſters ſakes, as a reſtraint (as is pretended) but for the poore Servants, and Beaſts ſakes to be refreſhed thereby, was this added in the Commandement. God having thus rendred an account of this paſſage, it is more ſubtile, then ſolid, &amp; ſavors more of acuteneſſe, then of religion, to affix to this expoſition any gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and conceits of our owne.</p>
               <p>The fourth hath already been ſatisfied in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion concerning the duration of the Lords day.</p>
               <p>To the fift it is indeed true, that all impediments of holy duties are forbidden by the ſame Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein the duty is required, though not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately as the duty it ſelfe, but incluſiuely by way of reduction only, as Privations are reduced to the ſame Predicaments with their habits: But that all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7847:130"/>and civill works, words, thoughts are ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to the duties of the Lords day, as are ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, unleſſe they hinder us in the publique worſhip, is utterly untrue. The text of <hi>Leviticus</hi> ſpeaks of the carnall Sabbathizing of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which being of it ſelfe a duty, was broken by any thing done by them. But we are Chriſtians, not <hi>Iewes.</hi> And whereas it is ſuggeſted, that ſecular diverſions ſteale away the minde from holy things, choaking the good ſeed of the word in us, it being impoſſible to ſerue God, and Mammon; this is true indeed, where the world is made an Idoll, and a mans affections are immoderately ſet upon outward things; and ſo the text alleadged doth expound it ſelfe; Now every mans reaſon will tell him, that there is a great difference between carking and careing for outward things, which at all times is unlawfull, as being the ſervice of Mammon: and the diſpatching of ſome accidentall occurrent, or ſecular diſcourſes, or ordinary affaires, which are alwayes lawfull, but when we ought to attend Gods publique worſhip.</p>
               <p>To the ſixth. Were the Minor propoſition true, it would well neere follow, that the actiue life ſhould be moſt miſerable, and little better then prophaneſſe; being, by reaſon of infinite ſecular imployments, made uncapeable of Righteouſneſſe, Peace, Ioy in the holy ghoſt.<note n="a" place="margin">Magni ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris fluctth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7847:131"/>world, it ſeemed a new tempeſt to his ſoule. But what is this to ſome triviall imployments of particular men, which may ſuddainly be tranſ-acted without tumult, or diſtraction? But to deſcend to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. It's moſt true, that faith, which purifieth the heart, is obtained by hearing the world, ſtrengthned by meditation, and conference; doth it therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that by whatſoever elſe we doe we deſtroy, or overthrow it? It is as if in naturall things we ſhould ſay, naturall life doth conſiſt in naturall heart, and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, both theſe be upheld by naturall food. whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore is not our naturall food, overthroweth our naturall heate, and moyſture, deſtroyeth naturall life in us; and ſo war me cloathes in winner may kill. Saving faith, and our honeſt imployments of this life are ſo farre from being incompatible, as that the one is preſerved, and cheriſhed by the other; when they are vndertaken, and performed, as they ought to be, in the Lords preſence with reverence, and feare, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, not intermitting the habituall bent of the ſoule towards heaven.

And laſtly, whereas it is ſaid, that probably Chriſt will come to

               <p>Secondly, true it is, that in all outward things, taken in a divided ſenſe, by themſelues conſidered, there is this vileneſſe and baſeneſſe, as is ſaid: but conſidered as they are, or at leaſt ſhould be uſed by a Chriſtian man in obedience unto God, who hath impoſed them upon us: and with faith in his promiſes to ſanctifie them unto us, accompanied with an unfained deſire to glorifie God in them, and for them, they begin to change their natures, and are no more baſe and vile, but honourable and glorious.

                  </label> I anſwer, that neither of theſe inconveniences will follow hereupon. For certainly it is lawfull in ſome caſes to apply particular judgements to particular ſinnes of particular men, but then we muſt proceed with theſe rules.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when the ſpirit of God ſhall be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale ſo much, we may warrantably publiſh unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, what the Lord hath revealed unto us. So it was lawfull for any man in <hi>Davids</hi> time to ſay, that when <hi>Ammon</hi> was murthered, <hi>Thamar</hi> deflowred, his wiues, and Concubines diſhonoured in the ſight of the Sun,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7847:133"/>all this befell him for his murther, and Adultery: for for the Prophet<note n="*" place="margin">2. Sam. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>2.</note> 
                  <hi>Nathan</hi> had foretold it by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall ſpirit. So <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> after their returne from the captivity, might warrantably ſay, that God brought that evill upon their Fathers, for ſuch and ſuch ſinnes, becauſe the Prophets had formerly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the ſame. Whenſoever therefore the ſpirit doth reveale it unto us by immediate, and extraordinary inſpirations, or mediatly by the word, threatning thoſe particular ſinnes with thoſe particular judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which we ſee to be executed upon them, we may, nay we ought both to obſerue it in others, and to lay it to heart in our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt be well aſſured, that the thing, which we will ſuppoſe to be puniſhed by the Lords immediate hand, be, not only in our opinions, but tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and indeed, a ſinne. This hath ground upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: for if it be threatned by God in Scripture, we may be well aſſured, it is indeed an evill, and hatefull in his ſight. If therefore it be a diſputable point in the Church of God, ſuppoſe the ballance be equally car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on both ſides; who are we, that we ſhould take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to pronounce a definitiue ſentence, condemning our Brethren, which<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 14.4.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtand or fall to their own maſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, when we finde by obſervation, that it ever hath been, and continually is ſo, at leaſt for the moſt part; we may, though not infallibly, yet more ſafely particularize in this kinde. So if the <hi>Barbarians</hi> had not miſtaken S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> for a murtherer, their judgement had been rightly pronounced out of that generall
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7847:133"/>
                  <hi>maxime,</hi> which holds at leaſt for the moſt part, <hi>Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſuffereth not a murtherer to liue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, when the ſinner is taken in the very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the ſinne doth either naturally, or morally co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate to his judgement, we may doe well to obſerue the Lords hand therein. So many times ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe kill immediatly of themſelues, and laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſſe begets mortall diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, when the Lord proceeds againſt men by the rule of Retaliation, dealing with them, as they haue dealt with others, meting to them their own meaſure. This indeed is remarkable, and a man may ſay with<note n="*" place="margin">Iudges 1.7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Adonibezek. As he hath done, ſo the Lord hath done.</hi> Thus oppreſſion is many times puniſhed with extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; diſobedience to Parents with rebellion of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; adultery with uncleaneſſe. In ſuch caſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may probably conjecture, though not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily define, becauſe the juſtice of God doth moſtly render unto men according to this rule, though not alwaies.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, the conſcience of the ſinner himſelfe is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times a good directer to point out unto us the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed thing.</hi> For as in other reſpects, ſo in this alſo, the Etymology of the Canoniſts doth well agree, when they define <hi>Conſcience</hi> by <hi>Conſonancy</hi> with God. <hi>Conſcientia eſt conſonant ia animi cum Dee.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is as it were <hi>Gods Concordance</hi> in a mans own boſome, eſpecially when we are under the hand of his juſtice.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, men muſt beware how they draw the Lord to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7847:134"/>their parties, forcing him to be of their faction even againſt his will. We fooliſhly goe about many times to advance our cauſe by obſerving of ſome accidents, which befall thoſe, who either in judgement, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice diſſent from us. But beſides that theſe be vaine obſervations, and next allied to ſuperſtition, if we hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to miſtake in our judgements, we make the Lord, as much as in us lieth, to beare falſe witneſſe with us, who is truth it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now whether the obſervations, which our Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharians haue made in this particular, be not of this raſh, preſuming, and prophane kinde, let any wiſe man judge, and (I wiſh) that they themſelues would well conſider. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, it was never yet revealed by Prophet, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, that God would thus, or thus puniſh honeſt, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and harmleſſe recreations upon the Lords day with ſuch, particular judgements, as are obſerved, to haue fal'n upon ſome particular perſons in divers quarters of this land. Let ſuch threatnings be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and ſomething is ſaid.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as wiſe, learned, holy men, as any of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary judgement, affirme, not nakedly by way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate, but with ſundry reaſons in writing, that ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations upon the Lords day, eſpecially in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is expreſſed in his <hi>Majeſties Declaration,</hi> are no ſinnes, as hath already been ſhewed. What inſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arrogancy therefore is it in theſe men, to cry out.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7847:134"/>Loe judgements, judgements from the Lord out of heaven? What is this, but fooliſhly to triumph before the victory, and vainely to think of our ſelues more highly, then we ought to think?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, is it ſo alwaies or for the moſt part, and doe not ſuch accidents fall out as frequently upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daies, and upon other occaſions? If the firſt be not affirm'd, as I am ſure it cannot, for there be thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands (the more is the pity) that prophane the Lords day in greater meaſure, then any of thoſe, in whom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances haue been made, which yet never felt any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary evils; 'Tis therefore a wicked and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian concluſion to ſay, Vengeance ſuffered them not to liue. If the latter be moſt true, ſurely we father not the judgements of God aright. When M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Trask</hi> was confuted in the pulpit for his error concerning his new imagined kingdome of Chriſt, and through the turbulency of his ſpirit not induring his reproofe came to be ſilenced, it happened that D. <hi>Sutton,</hi> who oppoſed him herein, had his next child ſtill-borne: Loe ſaid M. <hi>Trash</hi> to ſome of his friends, the Lord hath declared himſelfe to be on my ſide: the author of my ſilencing hath a child ſtill borne. Had this been a ſtrange accident, and not befalling other women, his collection had been probable; whereas now it was, I will not ſay, ridiculous, but moſt vainglorious, if not blaſphemous. The caſe here is much the ſame.</p>
               <p>Theſe Sabbath breakers were taken in the very manner, ad their prophanations did cooperate to their deſtruction.</p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:7847:135"/>
               <p>This indeed is our fourth rule, but ſtill ſuppoſing the thing in doing to be a ſinne well knowne, and not queſtioned to the contrary; ſuch as are thoſe of glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, drunkenneſſe, uncleaneſſe, which are the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that rule. For otherwiſe there is ſcarce any good thing, of which it may not be ſaid, that ſome or other haue been ſtrucken either with ſickneſſe, or death in the very doing: even preaching, and praying it ſelfe: The true eſtimation of things depends not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the events, or accidents accompanying them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is not conſidered by theſe Exclaymers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe, that haue thus miſcarried, ſwarued not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe directions, &amp; limitations preſcribed unto them; for if ſo, the blame reſts upon their own licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But it is taken hand over head; it happened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lords day, and this we think to be enough.</p>

               <p>Fiftly, what rule of Retaliation can be pickt from hence? what proportion is there between this preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſinne, and thoſe conceived judgments?</p>

               <p>THere remaines only the laſt ſcruple, which is, or can be incident to this ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> What duties of holineſſe are proper and eſſentiall to the Lords day; whether only the acts of publike worſhip with the congregation: or the private exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes alſo of thoſe head-graces, faith, hope, loue; unto which, whatſoever is in Chriſtian Religion, may be reduced? And this is indeed a point of chiefeſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, becauſe it is practicall; and practice being the life, and ſpirit of knowledge, the conſcience can never be throughly ſetled, untill this be diſcovered. Our literall Sabbatharians affirme in this queſtion; and ſo affirme, that they make the obſervation of the Lords day the very abridgment of Godlineſſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the firſt Table: and of righteouſneſſe; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſecond Table. And from hence proceed theſe wide outcries againſt any, that ſhall contradict them; that Religion is laid upon the back, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7847:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſet up in the roome thereof. Nay they ſo affirme in this point, as that their doctrine is made an open, and profeſſed ſnare; ſuch a manner of holineſſe being exacted, as that it is impoſſible for any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the ſtate of corruption, to ſanctifie a Sabbath in that manner, as is required of him, either in thought, word, or deed. I confeſſe were it true, that upon the Lords day a man, forſaking the naturall reſt of his bed ſooner then vpon other daies, muſt begin early in the morning with the acts of repentance, then proceed to the acts of faith, and after the duties of loue conclude with repentance: and this with that manner of ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and formality, which ſome require; it muſt needs be even to the beſt an utter impoſſibility, whether we looke at parts, or degrees. But that the obſervation of the Lords day, in that manner as the Lord himſelfe expects, whatſoever men pleaſe to impoſe, is not ſuch a <hi>Chimaera</hi> as they fancy, will appeare, I hope, in its due place.

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:7847:137"/>it is generally ſo in other places of Scripture, as in that of the Apoſtle,<note n="*" place="margin">Peter 1.16.</note>

               <p>Secondly, that, which is, and ought to be a common duty of all daies, is much more a particular duty on the Lords day. The reaſon hereof is, both becauſe the Lords day is in many reſpects to be preferred before all other daies: and becauſe it is ſet apart from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unto holineſſe. But the private exerciſes of all gracious habits with our ſelues, and our families are, and ought to be common performances upon all daies. For as they binde alwayes, ſo are they indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely commanded, without reſtraint to any ſet dayes; they are therefore much more required upon the Lords day, being the common duties of all dayes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, any duty is more required upon that time, on which, if rightly performed, it is more acceptable to God, then at any other time. For by this appeares, that God hath regard as well to the time, as to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But all the duties of holineſſe, even the private, and perſonall, and oeconomicall, are more acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, if performed on the day of his Sabbath. this appeares; firſt, by the words of the<note n="*" place="margin">Iſay 58.13.</note> Prophet ſaying, <hi>if thou turne away thy foote from the Sabbath, from doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy pleaſure upon my Holy-day, and call my Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and ſhalt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, not doing thine owne wayes, &amp;c.</hi> In which
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7847:138"/>words plaine it is, that the Lord as much preſſeth the time, as the duties. Secondly, by the Law of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For if any ſinne, as drunkenneſſe, uncleaneneſſe, blaſphemie, and prophaneneſſe be more abhominable in the ſight of God upon the Lords day, then upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other day; it muſt needs be, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vertues are more acceptable unto him alſo from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the day. But the former is generally affirmed, eſpecially of the <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> and is grounded upon that common Maxime in Morall Philoſophy, <hi>Bonitas &amp; malitia actionum pendet à circumſt antijs,</hi> the good and evill of our wayes are to be meaſured by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereof; and amongſt theſe the circumſtance of time is not to be ſleighted. <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the day of Chriſts corporall reſurrection from the graue requires of us aboue other dayes a ſpirituall reſurrection from ſinne in all the duties of holineſſe of what kind ſoever; for this being the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall uſe to be made of our Saviours reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the Apoſtle. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. it ſhould be chiefly practiſed on that day, on which the memory thereof is ſolemnized. All men will acknowledge, that when we doe the duty of the day upon the day it ſelfe, it is moſt ſeaſonable; and duties ſeaſonable doth the<note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 25.11.</note> 
                  <hi>wiſe man compare to apples of gold in pictures of ſilver.</hi> But the Lords day is the day of Chriſts reſurrection. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that Law, which doth enjoyne publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, doth alſo require of us all ſuch duties, as are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therances of the publike. For where the end is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7847:138"/>all ſuch meanes, as directly tend unto that end, are alſo under precept. But the Lords day requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth publique worſhip, as all acknowledge; and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, perſonall, and oeconomicall duties of holineſſe are maine helps, and furtherances thereof; both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring us thereunto, and putting life into our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and cauſing us to profit thereby. Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that, which was ſhadowed as a Type in the old Sabbath, is required as an Evangelicall duty in the new Sabbath, which is the Lords day; for all the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall</hi> ceremonies were ſhadowes of good things to come, to be performed partly by Chriſt, partly by his ſpirit in us. But this quiet reſt of the ſoule, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the ſpirit in the Lord by all the duties of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, was ſhadowed as a Type of the old Sabbath; therefore are they Evangelicall duties on the Lords day.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, though the letter of the fourth precept be Ceremoniall, yet is the equity thereof morall, and of this there is no queſtion. But the letter of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Sabbath required not only publique ſacrificing, but commanded alſo private reſt. <hi>For no man was to goe out of his place,</hi> ſaith the<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 16.29.</note> text.

                  <hi>CAP. XXVIII.</hi> The arguments for the Negatiue are breifly expreſſed.</head>
               <p>FOR the Negatiue tenent it is alſo ſaid.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that, which is every daies duty, is no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Lords day, as it is the Lords day; for then there ſhould be no difference at all between the Lords day, and other dayes, in regard of the duty therein required; which were to confound the Lords day, to the great diſparagement thereof, with other dayes. But the private exerciſes of thoſe fundamentall graces of faith, hope, loue are the duties of every day.</p>
               <p>If any ſay, that the difference conſiſts in this, that to common dayes appertaine only private duties, to the Lords day both private, and publike.</p>
               <p>The ſcruple ſtill remaineth in regard of thoſe dayes, wherein the publike worſhip of God is alſo in uſe, as
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:7847:140"/>Lecture-dayes, Holy-dayes, &amp;c. unleſſe we account thoſe daies alſo to be Sabbaths, which our adverſaries in this queſtion will not agree unto.</p>
               <p>If it be farther ſaid, that the difference ſtands in this, that in other dayes they are only habitually, but on the Lords day actually required.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that, in their other Tractates, an habituall ſerving of God is ſo farre rejected, as that they thinke it impoſſible to walk with any comfort with the Lord, vnleſſe we alſo adde thereunto ſundry actuall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; the time, and manners whereof they alſo ſhew us. If therefore any difference be, it is, that we muſt be wholy taken up with ſuch performances during the whole Sabbath for 24. houres: and turne meere <hi>Euchites</hi> upon the day, which is not required in other dayes. But that the Sabbath is of no ſuch length, hath been already declared; and that God giues no ſuch continuate taskes of holy performances, ſhall, I hope, before we part be made evident.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note n="d" place="margin">Finis non ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eſt de ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantià prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti, ne<expan>

                  </note> the end is not comanded by that Law, in which the meanes are preſcribed; for though the precept of the end include alſo the precept of the meanes, yet not on the contrary. This propoſition is laid downe by the <hi>Moraliſts</hi> as an undoubted <hi>max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime,</hi> and doth evidently appeare. For example, when we are commanded to heare the word, we are not by the force there of commanded to beleeue in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; yet<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 10.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Faith,</hi> (as ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>cometh by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi> That rule, which commandeth to beate downe the body, and to keepe it in ſubjection, doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:7847:140"/>of vs the vertues of humility, chaſtity, &amp;c. but on the contrary, theſe, being the end, require the other as the meanes. But the law of ſanctifying a holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is a law of the meanes, whereby we are taught, and enabled to ſerue the Lord in the private duties of holineſſe, and to exerciſe in our ſelues the graces of faith, hope, loue, &amp;c. This alſo is plaine of it ſelfe, and requires no farther proofe. For why doe we reſort to the congregation on the Lords day? But partly to be inſtructed by the word: partly to be inflamed with the loue of God, and zeale unto his ſervice the whole weeke after: as well, as to tender him our publike ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in acknowledgement of his ſoveraigne domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, no affirmatiue precepts are to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded beyond that, which the letter doth containe, though it be otherwiſe in precepts, which be negatiue. For example, <hi>honour thy father, and mother,</hi> when we know what it is to honour our Superiours, we haue the whole latitude of this Law. It is not ſo (I ſay) in negatiues: as appeares by our Saviours confutation of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> gloſſes upon the ſeventh Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the law of the Sabbath is an affirmatiue precept, and preſcribes the publique worſhip of God in the congregation; therefore is not farther to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if all duties of piety, and mercy whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were commanded by the law of the Sabbath, then were there no difference at all between this, and the other precepts of the Decalogue, at leaſt for that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7847:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>day: ſo that upon one day of every weeke the other Commandements were needleſſe, and ſuperfluous. But this is not to be affirmed.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reſp. </seg>
                  </label> I anſwer, that though this be moſt true, yet muſt we not confound the Law of God, and make an intricate maze thereof, to the entangling of mens conſciences; for the Decalogue is ſaid to be <hi>ten words, ten</hi> for their number, <hi>words</hi> for their diſtinction. I denie not, that one and the ſame duty may be under divers precepts; but then they are diverſly conſidered, as referred to divers ends. The object of different commandements may be materially the ſame, but formally diſtinct: So temperance and ſobriety may be both under the ſixt, and under the ſeventh precept; under the ſixt as meanes of preſervation of breath; under the ſeventh, as the helps unto chaſtity, and mortification. But what formality can diſtinguiſh the duties of holineſſe on the Lords day from the ſame duties on other daies, I know not; if you ſay, to ſanctifie the Sabbath, the queſtion is begged, and ſo nothing ſaid.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, were the whole practice of Religion both publique, and private the duty of the Lords day, then it would follow, which is alſo affirmed, that to obſerue the Lords day, were impoſſible to any man in the ſtate of corruption. For I think, no man, unleſſe he be ſome braine-ſick <hi>Perfectiſt,</hi> will challenge to himſelfe ſuch a meaſure of holineſſe, though but for a day. But that the law of the Lords day is thus impoſſible, being
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7847:141"/>not a Legall but Evangelicall obſervation of poſitiue command, (for all ſuch are light yokes and eaſie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens) is utterly untrue; <hi>Therefore, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, nothing, but what is naturall, and eternall, is commanded in the fourth precept of the Decalogue, binding us under the Goſpell: but that private, and perſonall acts of religion ſhould be performed by us preciſely upon this, or that day of publique worſhip, in that manner as is required, is not naturall, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, binding us under the Goſpell. For the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture preſcribes only in generall, not any thing for any time, or day, or manner in particular.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, that, which is no where ſpoken of, much leſſe commanded in the new Teſtament, bindes not the conſcience of any under the Goſpell: but the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate exerciſes of religion upon the Lords day are not ſpoken of, much leſſe commanded in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For then ſuch commands were eaſily ſhewed, &amp; all men would readily ſubmit themſelues thereunto.</p>
               <p>Eightly, this manner of obſervation ſeemeth to change the nature of the Lords day from being the Chriſtian Feaſt, and transformeth it rather into a day of Faſt, &amp; humiliation. For let their doctrine of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathizing be compared to the doctrine of faſting, and we ſhall finde them the ſame, ſaue only that a totall abſtinence from all things, wherein nature delighteth, is required in the one, but not ſo in the other. But we muſt not metamorphize the Lords day, which is, and ought to be the Chriſtian mans Feſtivall, wherein he ſhould not only inwardly, but out wardly alſo rejoice in the Lord his God.</p>

               <p>HAving thus laid downe that may probably be ſaid upon either part; for the better ſetling of the conſcience herein, theſe concluſions are to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that holineſſe, which is required of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, is of a large extent, taking in all the duties, which we owe to God, our brethren, and our ſelues. For<note n="*" place="margin">Pet. 1.16.</note> 
                  <hi>We muſt be holy, as God is holy,</hi> being created after his image; and this image doth conſiſt in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, as in the two integrall parts thereof; holineſſe relating, in a reſtrained ſenſe, unto piety and godlineſſe: righteouſneſſe unto juſtice and judgement; unto both which we ſtand alwaies obliged, and muſt practiſe them, when we are required thereunto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the duties of holineſſe, as contradiſtinct unto righteouſneſſe, are perfectly contained in the foure Commandements of the firſt Table, which are ſo many diſtinct Predicaments of all true piety. For although the duties of righteouſnes in the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble put on the attributes of holineſſe, as directed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, performed in obedience to his Majeſtie; yet are they not formally ſo in themſelues conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And although the ſame duties of piety may be comprehended within divers ſeverall precepts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:7847:143"/>yet there is ſtill to be obſerved ſome peculiar, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct conſideration, which puts them formally under ſuch, or ſuch a precept.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that therefore the law of the Sabbath in the fourth Commandement is no tranſcendent, comprehending all the duties of all the reſt, either of the firſt or ſecond Table: for then it muſt needs be the <hi>Summum genus</hi> to the reſt, out of which they all may be deduced, and into which they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. This is verified alone of thoſe two great Commandements, as our<note n="*" place="margin">Math, 22.38.</note> Saviour calls them: <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy ſoule, with all thy heart, with all thy minde, with all thy ſtrength: and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe:</hi> but cannot be affirmed of the fourth precept. For how can we either extract the reſt, or almoſt any of them out of this, or fold them up all therein? It would be a ſtrange inference, to ſay, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thou keep holy the Sabbath day:</hi> therefore <hi>thou ſhalt haue no other Gods;</hi> therefore <hi>thou ſhalt make no graven images;</hi> therefore <hi>thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine, &amp;c.</hi> and as ſtrangely would all theſe being put together make up that one; <hi>Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, that therefore there is ſomething apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to pietie, which is only to be found in this, and in no other precept of the Decalogue. Now what this is, will eaſily appeare, if we take a ſhort view of Gods worſhip, as it is preſcribed in the ſeverall Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. The worſhip of God is the immediate act of religion, which inclineth the heart and the whole man
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7847:143"/>to the ſervice of God. And becauſe God muſt be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not after our fancies, but as he himſelfe hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; therefore it is a good Etymologie of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, à relegendo ſeſe intra ſuos fines,</hi> contracting her ſelfe within the bounds, and limits, which are preſcribed her.

For it doth not only produce it's own operations, but doth command, as a Soveraigne Lady, all other vertues; according to that of S. <hi>Iames, true religion, and undefiled is to viſit the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſſe, and the widdowes, ad to keep himſelfe unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the world.</hi> This is religion not formally, but ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually religion, being the cauſe which doth produce them. But God having not only made us ſpirits, but bodies, in which our ſpirits dwell, as in houſes of clay; the duty of religion extends it ſelfe unto the outſide of man alſo, which muſt likewiſe giue God his owne. And religion, in this notion, is under the ſecond pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Decalogue; in which, as we are forbidden all Idolatrous ſervices whatſoever: ſo are we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſuch bodily teſtifications of our ſpirituall worſhip, as may beſt ſtand with the nature and will of that God, which is worſhipped by us. This though it be diſtinct from the former, yet is not excluſiuely to be underſtood, as if it only exacted formal poſtures and corporall proſtrations; for the<note n="*" place="margin">Iſai 29.13.</note> Prophet aſſures us, that thoſe, that think to worſhip God with theſe only, are abhominable in his ſight. Outward reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence muſt ever be accompanied with inward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſo performed it is commanded in this ſecond precept. Now it being a neceſſary conſequence, that perſons, ſo inwardly affected, &amp; outwardly regulated, will not at any time, and likely cannot, caſt any vile
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7847:144"/>aſperſions upon the Lord, or any thing that belongs unto him: but, on the contrary, readily ſpeak all good of his name, whatſoever it be, that makes him known unto us; therefore the third precept of religion giues us the holy mans Character, not <hi>to take the name of the Lord our God in vaine.</hi> Laſtly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that every reaſonable creature in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar muſt in this manner giue his Creatour his own; for the Lord having univerſall dominion over all fleſh, ſhould publiquely be worſhipped by ſocieties of men: therefore what the former precepts require of every one in particular, that the fourth precept injoines pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely to be performed by all aſſemblies throughout the whole earth. And herein, becauſe it is a thing of moſt dangerous conſequence to leaue men unto thè<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues (for then there would be as many fancies as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) God hath ever preſcribed publique rites, by which he would be publikely worſhipped, leaving the circumſtances thereof to the wiſdome, and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, if therefore we will ſpeak diſtinctly of the things of God, as is moſt fit we ſhould (for only a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct knowledge is the foundation of true pietie: as confuſed and indigeſted notions are the mothers of hypocriſie, and nurſes of ſuperſtition) e muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what are thoſe publique duties, whereby God is publiquely worſhipped; for only theſe are immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the fourth Comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement. Now the acts of divine worſhip, whether publique or private, are (as hath been ſaid) <hi>Adoration, Invocation, Dependance,</hi> or
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:7847:145"/>
                  <hi>Adhaeſion,</hi> and <hi>Thankſgiving. Adoration</hi> is the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Lord in our own thoughts, ſetting him in the higheſt roome of our hearts, and ſubjecting unto him the whole man, even the conſcience it ſelfe. <hi>Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is the lifting up the heart to the throne of his grace, acknowledging him alone to be the father, of whom is named the whole familie both of heaven &amp; earth, expecting all our wants to be ſupplied by him, and from him. <hi>Dependance</hi> or <hi>Adhaeſion</hi> is a faſt clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the Lord with full purpoſe of heart, wholy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting our ſelues upon his wiſdome, power, goodneſſe, juſtice, mercy, with all confidence, quiet, &amp; aſſurance. <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> is the tribute which we returne him, even the praiſe and glory of his grace. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſidering our ſelues to be the members of the myſticall body of the Church? we joyne unto the Lords people in acknowledgement of his ſupreme dominion in theſe performances of divine worſhip, we are diſcharged from the maine, principall and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall duties of the Lords day. And on the contrary, he, that either abſents himſelfe from the publike mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the place, where he is, (not being conſtrained thereunto by inevitable neceſſity) or being preſent in body, joynes not in ſpirit with his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named acts of publike worſhip, is an open, and direct prophaner of the day.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, we muſt alſo conſider, what be the generall helps, and furtherances of publike worſhip. Theſe are foure.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Paſtors and Miniſters are requiſite to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7847:145"/>the people, as their leaders in holy things, and to be in a manner Mediators, betweene God and them; hence are they ſaid to ſtand upon the mountaines, as the middle way, which makes their feet beautifull,</p>
               <p>Secondly, there muſt alſo ſet, and appointed places of publique aſſemblies; &amp; ſuch haue ever been even in the time of the Apoſtles immediately upon Chriſts aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly. Such was the houſe, wherein they were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> And this ſome are of opinion (how juſtly I ſay not) to be the meaning of that paſſage of the Apoſtle, where, ſpeaking of <hi>Priſcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> he ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 19.5.</note> 
                  <hi>likewiſe greet the Church, which is in their houſe.</hi> Sure we are, that the Sabbath, and the ſanctuary, are uſuall ioyned together. There muſt alſo be lawes, and conſtitutions for the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the publike aſſemblies, leaſt the diſorders of them bring both confuſion into, and contempt upon the Goſpell it ſelfe, as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpeaketh. Till order was ſetled in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> what manifold abuſes crept in amongſt them; pride in ſome, facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in others, ſenſuality and prophaneneſſe in many, like ſo many Vultures eating up the uery heart of all Chriſtian duties?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the people likewiſe muſt be inſtructed in thoſe things, which belong unto the worſhip of God, before whom they publikely preſent themſelues: and in all neceſſary points of faith, and life, that they may know how to walke before him unto all well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and full aſſurance of underſtanding. But here we muſt remember, that theſe are not in the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7847:146"/>directly and immediately, as things of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity, without which the Lords day could not be a holy Sabbath: but indirectly, and by way of conveniency, for the well or better being thereof. For ſuppoſe, there be no Miniſter in a Pariſh, a ſuppoſition not impoſſible by ſuddaine death, unexpected impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, particular perſecution; ſuppoſe alſo the uſuall place of meeting to be taken away by any accident, or calamity; ſuppoſe there were no lawes for to order ſuch aſſemblies, or Magiſtrates to execute thoſe lawes, as in the ruines of a State; I would not doubt but in ſuch caſes the Lords people might aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues upon the Lords day, adore the ſacred majeſtie of God, invocate his holy name, proteſt their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him, and giue him for a ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice the fruits of their lips. Elſe, how is<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 18.20.</note> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours promiſe appliable unto all men, <hi>where two or three be gathered together in my name, I will be in the mid'ſt of them?</hi> Elſe, how did many of the Primitiue Chriſtians (thinke we) keep the Lords day in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Apoſtles, having not as yet a ſetled Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery? Elſe, how doe thoſe, that travaile by Sea, (I think not, that every ſhip carrieth a Miniſter,) elſe how doe many of our Marchants in ſome factories in forraine parts, where the publike practice of their Religion is not tolerated, and a Miniſter of their owne is not to be had: I ſay, how doe theſe obſerue the Lords day? Surely if any or all of theſe imployments did inevitably caſt men upon the rock of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they were vtterly unlawfull for any Chriſtians
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7847:146"/>to undertake. It cannot therefore be ſufficiently admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whence that opinion was at firſt taken up, which is now miſtaken even for a <hi>Maxime</hi> in Religion; that unleſſe there be Preaching in a Pariſh, the Lords day cannot be ſanctified by the Pariſhioners. Nay many of our common people are at that height in this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as to think it an obligation lying upon their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to heare an Afternoones-Sermon alſo, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it may be had. If therefore their own Paſtor, either through ſickneſſe, or abſence, or other reaſons, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſatisfie their deſires herein; they forſake their owne Aſſemblies, and wander as their humours lead them. By this miſpriſion, that which is but a help un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worſhip, is eſteemed by the vulgar aboue the worſhip it ſelfe, and all the branches thereof; and as it was ſaid it another caſe, the Daughter hath eaten up the Mother. Farre be it from me to ſpeak, or ſo much as think in ſecret any thing in the prejudice of that great and glorious work of <hi>Preaching.</hi> Sooner ſhall my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth; for I know it to be Gods ordinance,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By it the underſtanding is informed; the memory refreſhed; the will inclined; the affections made pliable; the heart comforted; truth preſerved; errours and hereſies beaten downe. But yet farre be it from any man to make an Idole of it; which is done, when either we advance it aboue, or equall it
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7847:147"/>with the publique worſhip. By this prepoſterous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of many well-mined people, a grand inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience hath befallen the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from which moſt of her other miſchiefes are hatched; Firſt, in opinion, that he is no lawfull Miniſter, which is not a Preacher; Secondly, in practice, for all men; to avoid this exception, or brand rather, as ſuddainly turne Preachers, as they doe Miniſters. So that if any man conceiue a good opinion of himſelfe, that he may doe good in Gods Church by ſome wayes or other, he ſhuffles into holy orders, and immediately from them into the Pulpit; And every Youth, whoſe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance extends not it ſelfe beyond three or foure years in the <hi>Vniverſity,</hi> as ſoone as he is old enough, will be a Miniſter; and then 'tis a foule diſparagement to him not to be a Preacher. Hence eſpecially, partly through ignorance, partly through impudence, facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is fomented; the people humoured, and miſlead; Religion is made a Maze, &amp; quite changed from that, which originally it was.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, it is not to be doubted, that there may be alſo many perſonall furtherances of the publique wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, whereby particular men may be made more apt therevnto, more devoute therein, receiving great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and profit thereby. But that ſuch preparations, or previous diſpoſitions, or what elſe we pleaſe to call them, are under the precept of the Lords day, as it is our Chriſtian Sabbath, doth not follow. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, they are not of abſolute neceſſity, without which the publique worſhip muſt needs fall to the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7847:147"/>ground. I think no man will ſay, it is unpoſſible that a man ſhould worſhip God in publique, which hath not done it in private, otherwiſe then habitually. It is not here, as in acting a part upon the Stage, to which a man comes as a new thing never heard of before; for we are bred in a Chriſtian ſtate, nurſed in a ſolicitous Church, acquainted with God his word, his worſhip, as it were from the Cradle. Few men (I think) there are in our congregations, which cannot ſuddainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect themſelues from other diſtractions, to ioyne with our brethren in publique, unleſſe tranſported with unexpected, and violent temptations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, no particular rules can be preſcribed, which ſhall univerſally direct all men of all rankes, &amp; endowments; which not obſerved, they cannot wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in publique. Muſt we read the word of God in private? What ſhall become of them, whoſe educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath not extended to the <hi>Primmer?</hi> Muſt they pray in private, and ſecret, otherwiſe then the Church hath taught them? What ſhall ſuch doe as haue not the help of books, and are not arrived to their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perfection of extemporary effuſions? Muſt they repeat a Sermon, or Catechize their families &amp;c? what if they cannot? Where are thoſe duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> (as they ſpeak) upon the Lords day, but in publique Aſſemblies?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſing therefore a generall precept of preparation to the publique, which no man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for the<note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> holy Ghoſt commandeth it expreſſely, <hi>keep thy foot when thou goeſt into the houſe of God:</hi> The
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7847:148"/>Schooles teach us, that the manner of performing the duty fals not under the precept, in which the duties is commanded. If thy foot be kept, it matters not by what meanes thou keep it. In a word therefore, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall &amp; private helps of the publique worſhip, not as it is publike, and regarding the whole congregation, but looking to our owne profiting thereby, are only gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally commanded us; the particulars being left to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans diſcretion, and no mans conſcience is further burthened.</p>
               <p>Eightly, with reſervation therefore of Chriſtian liberty, thoſe, that can and will ſpend the vacant times of the Lords day in the private exerciſes of piety, are by no law prohibited, by no authority diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ought not by others to be diſheartened, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged rather; with theſe Proviſoes, Firſt, that they put no Religion therein, as if God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it at their hands, as a part of the dayes ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; for then are they guilty of will-worſhip. Secondly, that being perſonall devotions, they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſecret, for ſo<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 6.6.</note> our Saviour hath directed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that when they are extended unto the whole family, the Maſter of that oeconomicall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline be well fitted, and qualified thereunto, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not beyond his meaſure.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that he keep himſelfe within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of his owne charge, not admitting any of other places; for then he becomes offenſiue to the State, who hath, and that juſtly, a iealouſy over all ſuch Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:7847:148"/>
               <p>Fiftly, that, what is done herein, proceed from the ſincerity of his heart, without any reſpect unto ſiniſter ends; elſe they are meere pretences.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that they be not burthenſome to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants herein, ſo as to make them weary of good things, of which our natures are impatient; but ſo, as that the day be unto them both a ſpirituall, and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall refreſhing.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, all ſuch things whatſoever as keep us from, or hinder us in the publique worſhip, are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlawfull upon the Lords day. This concluſion is evident of it ſelfe from the premiſes, and concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the former queſtions, and is generally aſſented unto; only the ſcruple is,</p>

               <p>I would gladly know, what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the publique worſhip upon the Lords day, and the ſame upon other daies. The ſame word is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the ſame prayers uſed, the ſame hymnes are

Then they ſteale not away the ſeed ſowne, they choak not the good word of God, they driue not out of our hearts either the exhortations of the Miniſter: or ſecret motions of the ſpirit; why then muſt they doe this upon the Lords day: haue the ordinances of God leſſe vertue? hath the day leſſe promiſe of grace? Are our hears then more unreachable? Are they not deſtructiue of good things at other times? and are they ſo at this time? By this it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that we place ſome holineſſe in the day it ſelfe.

For my own part, I think, all kinds of holy frauds (under which perhaps theſe Sabbatharian tenents may be ranged) by whomſoever practiſed: or what advantages ſoever may acrue there from, to be groſſe deluſions of men, meere mockings of God, and moſt unbeſeeming the profeſſion of the Goſpell. As for the well-minded Chriſtian, that takes offence, he is rather to be pitied, then humoured, and ought to be well informed of paſſiue ſcandalls.

Laſtly, how can the conſcience be ſatisfied herein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing utterly leſt to ſeeke, by our adverſaries themſelues, where to begin, or where to end the day? nay the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:7847:152"/>being utterly ſilent in this particular, if we ſpeak of the Lords day, as being our Chriſtian Sabbath.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, the Lords day may be conſidered,</p>
               <p>Firſt, in it's abſolute nature, as a part of our time; &amp; in this reſpect it is moſt true, that, what is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon duty of all daies, ſhould be alſo that daies duty; the rather, becauſe all other imployments are abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and therefore more leaſure is afforded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in his relatiue nature, as ſeparated from the reſt of the week to the ſervice of the congregation; and ſo there are eſpeciall duties appointed, which are not common to other daies by vertue of the fourth Commandement. The reaſon, from the leſſe to the greater, is of no force, becauſe it ſpeaks not <hi>adidem;</hi> for the Lords day, as it is a day, and part of our time, is no better then other daies; but as it is the Lords day devoted by the Church to the Lords ſervice, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Queene of daies, and therefore therein the higheſt and nobleſt Chriſtian duties are performed in the publique worſhip, even by the precept of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>To the third, Familie-duties are not acceptable unto God performed upon one day more then upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if there be no other conſiderations concurring thereunto.

                  <hi>Gerſon</hi> affirmes of Churches &amp; conſecrated places in regard of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we doubt not to affirme of the Lords day in regard of all holy duties. The Church or conſecrated place (ſaith he) is, by reaſon of its venerable condition, <hi>ad poenitentiam provocativus,</hi> a place provoking unto repentance; &amp; from hence he hath theſe concluſions. Firſt, that ordinarily it is a work more holy in it ſelfe, more pleaſing unto God, more profitable unto us, to pray in conſecrated places, then elſewhere; becauſe the Majeſtie of the conſecrated place doth more incite
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:7847:153"/>us unto devotion. Secondly, that all blaſphemy, either in words, deeds, or ſignes is ſo much the more exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable, by how much the place is more holy. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that one cauſe, why wicked Prieſts are worſe then wicked Lay-men (which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> faith, he often found by experience) is, that they abuſe thoſe things which ſhould winne them unto repentance. Fourthly, that thoſe affections, which ſeparate from God, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where damnable, but much more in the Temple: as appeares by our<note n="*" place="margin">John 2, 16.</note> Saviours overthrowing the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the mony-changers there. So ſay we, that the Lords day, by reaſon of the glorious dedication of it to the Lord Chriſt, as the memoriall of his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is in it's ſelfe provoking unto newneſſe of life; that holy duties are on this day ordinarily performed with greater fervency of ſpirit, benefit to our ſelues, and therefore acceptance with God; becauſe the Glory of the day is apt to put life unto our performances; that all irreligious converſation is therefore the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable upon that day; that the reaſon, why wicked ecrable upon that day; that the reaſon, why wicked Chriſtians are worſe then Godleſſe Heathens, many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is, becauſe they abuſe all ſuch things, whereby the Lord would draw them unto himſelfe, &amp; amongſt others the Lords day; that all thoughts, words, and waies, which ſeparate from God, are alwaies damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but much more upon the Lords day from this ground and no other. But hence as it doth not follow on the one ſide, that it is not lawfull elſewhere to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of our ſinnes, or to make our prayers unto God, ſaue in conſecrated places; or that whenſoeuer we
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:7847:153"/>come there, we ſin, if we performe not theſe duties: ſo neither here, on the other ſide, muſt we conceiue, that no holy duties are to be done but on the Lords day: or that we break the Law of the Sabbath, if, during the whole day, we doe not performe them.</p>
               <p>And by this, which hath been hath ſaid, not only the preſent argument receiues full ſatisfaction: but (if I miſtake not) that great ſtumbling block of theſe times, of <hi>bowing toward the Communion Table</hi> is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the way of all well-affected people.

And for my part (if this be all, which is practiſed; I am ſure, it's all, which is taught by the Learned, even in the Popiſh Schoole it ſelfe) I ſee no reaſon, why, if a day <hi>quatenus</hi> a ſeparated day may be thus <hi>memoratiue,</hi> a Table or ALTAR (call it what you pleaſe) thus ſeparated, may not be ſo likewiſe: or why we ſhould not readily imbrace all occaſions, opportunities, helps, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therances of worſhipping the perſon of our Lord <hi>Chriſt;</hi> whoſe honour is generally impaired by ſundry Heretiques, and moſt maliciouſly fought againſt by Satan, Anti-Chriſt, and all his complices. Which is ſome had well underſtood, it had not been poſſible for them to haue ſtumbled thereat; at leaſt they would haue forborne many uncharitable invectiues againſt their brethren, who, upon thoſe grounds, exerciſe this worſhip.</p>
               <p>To the fifth, all meanes, directly tending to any good end, are included in the precept of the end; but private duties, as they are here required, are no where commanded as meanes unto the publique, but rather
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:7847:154"/>on the contrary; for we doe not therefore accuſtome our ſelues to private duties, that ſo we may be able to ſerue God in publique: but we therefore attend the publique, that thereby we may be the better enabled to worſhip him the whole week after. So that if the Lords day be indeed ſanctified by the ſyncere perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of publique duties; the conſcience is not far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obliged under the penalty of ſinne, by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yet reveal'd concerning the Lords day.</p>
               <p>To the ſixth, it is moſt true, that the ſpirituall repoſe of the ſoule was ſhaddowed out unto us by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall reſt of the body in the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Sabbath; ſo that our whole life ſhould be a holy reſt unto the Lord from the ſervile works of ſinne and Satan; and how men ſinne againſt the Lords day in particular, if the Conſecrated day be not a motiue unto them of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hath already been ſaid. But that the day it ſelfe and the ſanctification thereof, ſuch as is here preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed us, was prefigured by the old Sabbath, we vtterly deny; that which was ſhaddowed thereby, being the duty of the whole time of the Goſpell, not of any particular day.</p>
               <p>To the ſeventh, there is no proportion at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe pretended obſervances, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> private reſt; for certaine it is, that when amongſt them no man went out of his place upon the Sabbath day, they performed a publique duty, celebrating thereby that common reſt, which they had now obtained from the ſlavery of <hi>Egypt,</hi> wherein every family, and perſon amongſt them ſhared.</p>

               <p>Secondly, that only was required of them, which was moſt eaſy for every one to performe; whereas thoſe holy performances, which are here required, come not within the reach of every mans meaſure.</p>
               <p>To the eight, ſuppoſing that, which many of the Schoolemen teach concerning our edifying in holy things on the Lords day, the argument is faulty in its other propoſition. For that we cannot learne of the Lord in publique without private exerciſes ſo varied and ſpunne along throughout the whole day is not true: neither can any thing be univerſally affirmed herein, conſidering the different ſtates, graces, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of men.</p>
               <p>To the ninth, the Lords day is ſaid to be holy, no otherwiſe then other things, which are conſecrated to Gods publique, and holy worſhip: and how farre things of this nature are apt of themſelues, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe often cooperate unto holineſſe in us, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been declared.</p>
               <p>To the tenth, it is moſt true, that God intended by the Law of the Sabbath to mind his people of the worlds
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:7847:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>creation in ſix dayes, but that he did bind them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to contemplate the particulars thereof, which few but Philoſophers are able to doe, I think no man will affirme. So the Lords day was ſett a-part for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Chriſts reſurrection. But what thoſe private duties are unto this, I ſee not, unles you ſay that article is to be ſtudyed. And to ſpeak truth, if men would upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this day preach Chriſt in publique. &amp; ſpend their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meetings only upon this ſubiect (for Chriſt is a Theame ſeldome inſiſted upon) true Chriſtianity would be better knowne, mens conſciences would be better ſetled, thoſe meetings more charitable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and none could oppoſe them therein. But as the Proverb is <hi>Quid haec ad Icphali boves,</hi> to the continuate, and un-interrupted exerciſes, of which we ſpeak?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, thoſe Authorities, which are and may be brought to this purpoſe, (to which may be added, that <hi>Canon</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the dayes of King <hi>Edward,</hi> for ſpending the Lords day in private prayer, and thankſgiuing; acknowledging our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, reconciling our ſelues unto our brethren, viſiting the ſick, comforting the afflicted, releiving the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the poore, inſtructing children, and ſervants in the nurture and feare of the Lord) are not delivered by the Church, or ancient Fathers, as expoſitions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fourth Commandement: as if they were the duties of the Lords day, as it is a Sabbath but only as pious and Godly admonitions, where by to traine up men in religion, and allure them unto holineſſe.<note place="margin">Num. 11.29.</note>

And here let the Reader take notice; firſt, of that, which<note n="a" place="margin">The obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Chriſtian Sabbath. <hi>Pag</hi> 15.</note> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Sprint</hi> hath well obſerved, that in the moſt materiall points we conſentingly agree, though in certaine circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we differ, each one abounding in his ſeverall fence; which makes it ſtrange to me, that our Adverſaries ſhould ſo ſtick in theſe points, even againſt Authority it ſelfe; ſince we ſo conſentingly agree in points mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall. This I ſay being premiſed, not to take notice of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, which might be collected out of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall treatiſes hitherto extant; I conceiue, that the fineſt thread, in which theſe <hi>Sabbatharian</hi> poſitions can be ſpun, may be thus drawn. Firſt, that God, having crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, revealed unto him the creation, with the order, and manner, and time thereof, within the compaſſe of ſix dayes. That the ſeventh therefore was the day of his reſt, which he would haue obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a Sabbath by him and his poſterity. That this
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7847:157"/>day was moſt fit to be appointed; not only in regard of God, who then reſted; but in regard of man alſo, who was on the ſeventh day to enter upon the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, as the Maſter thereof; and what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter entrance, then with the ſervice of his Creatour, in ſanctifying the Sabbath day. That hence came all his time to be divided by weeks, the boundary whereof was, and that by diuine inſtitution, the Sabbath, God having bleſſed the ſeventh day and hallowed it. That this hallowing the day, was the declaration of Gods will; not what himſelfe meant to doe long after, but what he would haue men to doe from that time forth in all their generations. That thus it continued in the practice of the <hi>Patriarches,</hi> before, and after the flood; for elſe it had been impoſſible for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to haue known (as it is plaine they did by their gathering of <hi>Manna</hi>) which were the ſix dayes of the creation, and which the ſeuenth of Gods reſting. For ſure we are, the time was firſt divided into weeks; moneths, &amp; yeares, being not knowne, till by long obſervation found out by the courſe of the Sunne, &amp; Moone. That though in this manner the Sabbath was given <hi>Adam</hi> by poſitiue Law, yet eaſy it is to follow the footſteps of nature guiding us thereunto. For all men acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, even by naturall light, that ſome time is to be ſett a-part for the publique worſhip; but being to ſeek of the proportion in ſpeciall, and portion in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, nature kindly reacheth forth her hand, guiding us to theſe alſo, aſſuming as followeth. That not only ſome time, but a ſufficient proportion there of is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7847:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>required, as to all other workes, ſo to this of the publique ſervice. That reaſon teacheth, it is fit the Creature ſhould waite the leaſure of his Creatour in the deſignation of this ſufficient proportion: the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being under his abſolute power, and being no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall carver to it ſelfe in things of this kind, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping alſo greater comfort in any obſervance, for which it hath the warrant of its Creatour. That ſeeing the week was the originall partition of time, it muſt needs be more convenient to ſett one day of the week a-part for the ſervice of God, then one in a fortnight, or one in a month. That herein an uniformity ought to be obſerved by all man-kind throughout all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; without which, there muſt needs follow a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt <hi>Schiſme</hi> in the Church, rent in the State, and alſo in the world, if ſome in ſome places obſerue one day Sabbath, others in other places another day. That there is no ſuch ground of uniformity, as the word of God, to whom all men owe and profeſſe there ready ſubjection; as for mens conſtitutions, though upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo good groundes, there are others as wiſe, &amp; good as they, at leaſt in their owne opinions, which will take liberty to vary from them. That therefore it is fit, God himſelfe ſhould ſhew us, not only the ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate proportion, but the particularity of that ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That in ſuch deſignations as theſe, the will of God is made manifeſt unto us, ſometimes by his words, ſometimes by his works; ſo that if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were ſilent, as it is not, yet this is a generall dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that the work of God done upon any day, is, and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7847:158"/>ought to be the ground of its hallowing: If therefore we diſcerne one day to be preferred before another in ſome great and notable work, naturall reaſon teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that day of all others to be choſen for our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Sabbath. That thus ſtands the caſe both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Iewiſh,</hi> and Chriſtian Sabbath; God having marked out unto them their Sabbath by the work of creation, ours by the work of reſurrection. That there needs no ſuch recourſe notwithſtanding to the works of God, having ſo expreſſe a Text, as that of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> for the making good whereof againſt the fond Dreame of <hi>Anticipation,</hi> may be brought whole Iuries of Fathers and moderne Divines. And reaſon it ſelfe averreth it by an unanſwerable <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma;</hi> for that paſſage muſt be written either before the Law; and then God muſt reveale to <hi>Moſes</hi> before hand what he meant to doe in the Mount, which is not probable: or after the law, and then what reaſon had <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſpeak there of in the ſtory, ſince it was ſo fully declared in the Tables? That of thoſe three things before ſpoken of, the time in generall, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in ſpeciall, and taxation in particular, the firſt only is generally received for Moral; the other two are Poſitiue rather then Ceremoniall; for what need of Ceremonies in Paradiſe? That the ſpecification of one in ſeven was ceremoniall only reſpectiuely to the reſt of the ſeventh day, not of the ſeventh it ſelfe; for what ceremony can be found in the time indefinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, which is one of ſeven? That the <hi>Iewes</hi> reſting upon their ſeventh, did prefigure Chriſts reſt in the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:7847:158"/>graue, (in which fence alſo it is aboliſhed) but not our reſt from ſinne here, and from miſery hereafter; for theſe were common to the <hi>Iewes</hi> together with the Chriſtians. The reſt therefore of the day, was partly Morall, partly Ceremoniall; but not that one in ſeven ſhould be ſanctified, for that this is ſimply Morall, we haue the full cry of the Schoole-men themſelues. That the particular taxation of this one in ſeven more then of another was alſo Poſitiue, not Ceremoniall; for there is the ſame taxation of one in ſeven under the Goſpell, and yet no Ceremony is put therein; nay God having as it were chalked it out unto us by his works, it may well be reputed Moral. As therefore God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Iewes</hi> their day: ſo hath he alſo appointed us ours, even the firſt day of the week for our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sabbath; That herein the wiſdome of God is moſt remarkable in his Law, ſaying not, Remember the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, but Remember the Sabbath day the day of Reſt to ſanctifie it. For by this meanes we alſo keep the fourth Commandement, in ſanctifying the Lords day; For as the <hi>Jewes</hi> were tyed to the obſervation of the Sabbath, and had one of he ſeven preferred unto them: So we haue alſo our Sabbath, and one alſo of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven preſcribed us. That though we take not the Lords day as it is ſuch a day of ſeven, from the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet the reſt, and ſanctification thereof, we juſtly deriue from thence. That undoubtedly the Goſpell doth not allow a worſe proportion of time for the worſhip of God, nor a worſe manner of obſerving it, then the law did: and a greater doth not well ſtand
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7847:159"/>with our ordinary callings. That ſeeing the day of the Creatours reſt is aboliſhed, none of the ſeven can be more proper for a Chriſtian mans obſervation, then the day, on which his Redeemer reſted; whom the<note n="*" place="margin">Mark. 2.23.</note> Scripture ſtiles <hi>Lord of the Sabbath;</hi> For God marked it out unto the Apoſtles, to whom the tranſlation of the day appertained by the reſurrection of Chriſt, a work no way inferiour to the Creation. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is <hi>the day, which the Lord himſelfe hath made,</hi> faith the Prophet, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 118. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. That although there be no expreſſe proofe in Scripture, yet ſufficient it is to proue an inſtitution, from the continuate, un-inrer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted practice of the Church, which cannot be caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; and indeed nothing elſe can ſatisfie any, whoſe judgment, and conſcience cannot be overawed by the ordinance of the Church. That therefore we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this to be our Chriſtian Sabbath, (for ſo we may juſtly call it, though neither Scripture, nor Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſo ſtile it, becauſe all acts of Parliament, and Proclamations of the State ſo entitle it) being I ſay our Sabbath, we are to ſanctifie it in all points, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> did theirs, both for the time, which muſt be 24. houres: and for the reſt, doing nothing, which may be an avocation from holy things. As for ſports and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, howſoeuer the guilded titles of Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, honeſt recreations, and the like be put upon them, yet it may juſtly be feared, leaſt prophaneſſe and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urie be thereby intended, and a wide gapp ſet open to all licentiouſneſſe. That all men know, how ſyncere ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the mind of the Magiſtrate be, how greedily the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7847:159"/>vulgar are ſet upon theſe ſports, how incroaching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on liberty, how undiſcreet in enjoying it, how impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of any reſtraint therein. On the other ſide, that the Saints delight in conſecrating a Sabbath glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly unto the Lord; ſo that when others, inſtead of refreſhing, toyle themſelues in May games, or Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricedaunces, or worſe, finding perhaps their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure therein; the Saints finde nothing ſo ſweet, as the Lords ſtatutes, nothing ſo raviſhing as the refreſhings of the holy Ghoſt, nothing ſo amiable as the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of their Brethren, being made thereby more painefull and conſcionable in their ſeverall callings the whole weeke after.</p>

It is true, that God created <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe; but not true, that the creation of the world was made knowne unto him by revelation; for then, to what pupoſe was his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent knowledge, in which he was created, (and which many preferre beyond that of <hi>Solomons</hi>) imparted unto him? That God commanded the firſt ſeventh day to be his Sabbath is very improbable; for what needed <hi>Adam</hi> a Sabbath in Paradiſe? And if he ſinned the ſixt day (as moſt conceiue) this was a bad prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the next dayes Sabbath, &amp; ſuch, as was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſturb the whole work. If he ſtood the ſixt day and ſinned the ſeventh (long he ſtood not all agree) was the day of his fall, think you, the day of his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath?
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7847:160"/>That he entred upon the dominion of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon the ſeventh day, contradicts the very Text it ſelfe, which ſaith, they were delivered up unto him upon the ſixt day; unleſſe we like to interpret <hi>Moſes</hi> by the figure <hi>Anticipation</hi> in that Chapter, which is ſo much condemned in the next. That time was firſt divided by weeks, afterward by months, which is the very pillar of all the reſt; is as weakly, as confidently affirmed: For not to ſpeak of the circle here uſed, the diviſion of time into weeks being brought to proue the Sabbath to haue beene from the beginning: &amp; the Sabbath being bleſt &amp; ſanctified from the beginning to proue this diviſion of time by weeks; no ſuch thing can be concluded from that Text; unleſſe we grant, that all ſeparated and ſanctified daies (and ſuch were all the Iewiſh Feſtivalls) are preſently to be the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of time. On the other ſide, ſure we are, that man in the beginning was put to Schoole unto the creature, and that the Sunne and Moone were purpoſely ſet in the Firmament to ſhew him times and ſeaſons. Is it now probable, or can it ſtand with the intention of the Creator, that man ſhould come by the diviſions of times, otherwiſe, then by obſerving the Sunne, and Moone, eſpecially ſince the Changes of the Moon doe ſo punctually lead us unto weeks? In the next place, it was wiſely foreſeene, that a poſitiue precept ſerues not our turne; and therefore we fetch about for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality alſo therein, which cannot be without ſundry ſuppoſitions. That nature tels us of time to be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for Gods worſhip, is moſt true; but that ſhee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7847:160"/>us to this in ſpeciall, or that in particular, is falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly collected. For what if the creature be under the abſolute power of the Creator, are therefore no Circumſtantials left to the diſcretion of the Church in holy things? What though ſome particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would unequally carue therein, as <hi>Prometheus</hi> did betweene himſelfe and <hi>Iupiter;</hi> would the Church alwaies aſſiſted by Gods ſpirit, think we, doe the like? So for the comfortable performance, which is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I would aske, which is more comfortable, when we haue ſome things voluntary, which may be a free gift<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or when we are fettered in our performances, like flaues, more then ſonnes? Laſtly, that uniformity in publique actions cannot be obſerved, unleſſe God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe his immediate authority, ſavours of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, then Sabbatharian tenents. If thoſe daies are alwaies holy, which are honoured with ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table work of God, I ſee no reaſon, why the day of our Saviours incarnation and hypoſtaticall union the moſt unſearchable<note n="a" place="margin">Nunquam 'Deus adeò grande fecit miraculum in caelo, aut ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>râ, ſive reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcitando mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuos, ſive illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minando cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos, &amp; ſic de aliis; ſicut eſt miraculum hoc' unionis humanitatis addivinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.

Surely, although all Sabbaths haue beene kept upon daies chalked out by Gods famous works, yet all daies thus chalked out haue not been forthwith Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths by divine inſtitution.

                  <hi>Calvin</hi> hath long ſince obſerved, that it did not only hiſtorically teach
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7847:161"/>the <hi>Iewes</hi> the perfection of the works of nature, but myſtically alſo the perfection of the works of grace; and that nothing ſhould be wanting unto us in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the promiſed <hi>Meſsias,</hi> the number of ſeven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the number of perfection. Alike ſolid is that, which followeth, that the Reſt of the ſeventh day had relation unto Chriſts reſt only in the Graue; but was not myſtically referred unto the grace of the Goſpell; which is contrary both to the Scripture, and to the ſtreame of all Divines, Ancient and Moderne. And what if the <hi>Iews</hi> were partakers of the grace of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> yet were they led thereunto by the hand as children, in theſe and the like figures; and how doth this hang together, There is a taxation of one in ſeven under the Goſpell, therefore that, which the <hi>Iewes</hi> had under <hi>Moſes,</hi> could not be ceremoniall? That we under the Goſpell keep the fourth Commandement is moſt true, underſtood in generall of the ſubſtance of the Commandement, for times of publique worſhip, but in nothing elſe. For thought it ſay, <hi>Remember the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day,</hi> not the ſeventh; yet immediatly it addeth, by way of expoſition, <hi>the ſeventh is the Sabbath;</hi> and which it meaneth of the ſeventh, even the next after the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We muſt not then make God wiſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our fancies, by making his word a <hi>Lesbian</hi> rule, broken aſunder, and patched together at our own pleaſures. But ſay, it ſpeaks of a Sabbath in generall, how doth it ſpeak of a ſeventh day-Sabbath in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all under the Goſpell, or of the Lords day in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar? This therefore muſt be helped with another

Chriſtians, you ſay, muſt not giue a worſe time unto the Lords ſervice, then did the <hi>Iewes;</hi> muſt it therefore be juſt the ſame; that a better would proue a publique grievance, is a plauſible put off; why might we not giue him every ſixt day, if the whole Church ſhould think it fit? would it not be all one upon the matter to Tradeſ-men &amp; Labourers? But the Lord hath marked out unto us his own day by his own reſurrection. This is moſt true, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church alwaies hath, and I doubt not but ever wil obſerue it to the worlds end, though only by the Churches authority. But ſuppoſing it to be our Sabbath, muſt it not be kept for time and manner, as that of the <hi>Iewes</hi> was? If it be not the Iewiſh, why ſhould we keep the Iewiſh time of juſt ſo many houres, with the Iewiſh manner of reſt for ſuch or ſuch ceſſations? As for the reſt, he that is a Teacher of prophaneneſſe, and an Abettour of licentiouſneſſe, an untempered morter-dauber, let him be accurſed.</p>
               <p>The other patterne of doctrine therefore in this point, is. That God created man in that high meaſure of knowledge, <hi>as made him little lower then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 8.5.</note> That man continued in this eſtate but a very ſhort time, perhaps not many houres. That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his fall, a great part of his wiſdome remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him, eſpecially his naturall knowledge of the creature, and the worlds creation. That God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fal'n man into the ſtate of grace through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, was pleaſed to converſe with him (though not ſo familiarly, as otherwiſe he would haue done),
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7847:162"/>by apparitions, and revelations. That the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture remaining, taught him, that this God muſt be publiquely worſhipped. That he being not unminde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his fall, and the curſe, which thereby was brought upon him, death: and being inſtructed in the faith of the <hi>Meſsias</hi> to be ſlaine, hence God came to be publiquely worſhipped by the ſacrifices of ſlaine beaſts. That the ſet time of this publique ſacrificing is not mentioned in Scripture. That the place in the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis</hi> was written by <hi>Moſes</hi> after the Law was given, and had relation thereunto. That nothing can be averred of the Patriarchs practice till Iſraels comming into the wilderneſſe, and the fall of <hi>Manna.</hi> That the Law delivered in the fourth precept is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for ſubſtance, as that God muſt haue times for publique worſhip; Ceremoniall for circumſtance in the reſt, binding the <hi>Iewes</hi> only, &amp; leading them part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly backward, to their ſtate in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the fall of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na: partly forward, to good things to come in Chriſt. That Chriſt therefore and the Goſpell being exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, this circumſtantiall Sabbath muſt ceaſe; but expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not quite untill the deſtruction of the Temple. That during this while, the Apoſtles kept the Iewiſh Sabbath, as they did other Ceremonies. That withall they kept in a manner the Lords day alſo for breaking of bread, though this was not alwaies done upon that day only. That whatſoever the Apoſtles did in the Churches by them planted, was not by Apoſtolicall authority, they being the Churches Paſtors, as well as Chriſts Apoſtles. That the diſcipline of the Church
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7847:162"/>(of which the time and manner of publique Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies is not the leaſt part) was eſtabliſhed by them, as Paſtors, not Apoſtles: and might afterward receiue ſuch changes, as the ſtate of ſucceeding times ſhould require. That therefore the inſtitution of the Lords day is by Eccleſiaſticall authority; and that this is a ſufficient tye of conſcience to all ſuch, as liſt not to be obſtinately wilfull. That the Lords day thus eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed muſt be obſerved, and ſet apart for Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique worſhip; and all meanes uſed for the ſupporting thereof. That thoſe, that joyne not with the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation therein, are guilty of prophanation. That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth hinder this in any man (of which no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule can be given) ought to be avoided by him; and that herein every mans experience can beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme him. That ſuch things, as are uſed only as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of the minde, and recreations of the body, are lawfull on this day, ſo they offend not in any other circumſtance. That thoſe, that are inclined, and inabled to private holy exerciſes performed without fraud, or ſiniſter reſpect, doe that, which is moſt profitable and commendable, though not bound thereto by the Law of the Lords day. That all men ſhould be watchfull over themſelues to keep a ſpirituall Sabbath from the ſervile works of ſinne throughout the whole courſe of this life having alwaies an eye to that Sabbath of Sabbaths, promiſed us in the kingdome of GOD our Father, and of his deare Sonne IESUS CHRIST, to whom be honour, and glory now and for ever more. <hi>Amen.</hi>
